## Structure of the Repository

- `Homework 1/`: Contains all materials related to the first homework assignment.
- `Homework 2/`: Includes code, datasets, and documentation for the second homework assignment. Key topics covered include Hidden Markov Models for part-of-speech tagging and machine learning applications using scikit-learn.

## Homework 2 Overview

Homework 2 is structured into two main parts:

1. **Part 1: Hidden Markov Models**  
   This section deals with the implementation of Hidden Markov Models for part-of-speech tagging. The tasks include initializing and implementing the Viterbi algorithm, calculating tag permutations, and evaluating the model's performance.

2. **Part 2: Vectorizing and Machine Learning with scikit-learn**  
   Here, we focus on text classification using various feature extraction techniques and model training using scikit-learn's machine learning algorithms.

Each part contains detailed instructions, code snippets, and tests to ensure the correct implementation of the algorithms.

## Usage

Each homework folder contains Jupyter notebooks with detailed instructions and code cells. To run a notebook:
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Navigate to the respective homework folder.
3. Open the `.ipynb` file and run the cells in order (IMPORTANT!).

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, spaCy
- Jupyter Notebook

For detailed version requirements and installation instructions, refer to `requirements.txt` in each homework folder.
