STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC\n\n\tYour natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to\npanic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right\nwith God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your \nonly chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the \nTribulation.  "But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be \nsaved." - Matthew 24:13\n\nII. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\n\n\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\nthe rapture until Christ\'s second coming.  Also know as "the time of Jacob\'s\n(Israel\'s) trouble" (Jere 30:7) and "Daniel\'s Seventieth Week" (Dan 9), this \nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\n\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\n\n\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \npossession during the Tribulation.\n\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\nunfold before you.  \n\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\n\n\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\nsake of Christ.  \n\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\n\n\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\nuseless.  "And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\nis 666" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \n\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist\'s\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) "...I saw\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\nkilled as they were, was completed." Revelation 6:9, 11.\n\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ "...And I saw the souls of \nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\non their foreheads or on the hands." - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\nthe mark.  \n\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\nof Fire.

An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb." -Revelation \n14:9-10 \n\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \n\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\n\n\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist\'s government\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\n\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist\'s control will come last to the least\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\n["As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\nclosings" --M] \nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\n\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\n\t\n\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist\'s\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\n\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\n\n\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\n\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\n\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\n\n\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \n\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be "faithful unto death."\n\n\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\n\n******************************************************************************\nMike Cluff\t\t\t\t*  "Christianity is Stupid.\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\t*   Give up." -Negativland\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\t*  \n******************************************************************************\n\n\n/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\ \n\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \n\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.', 'I agree thouroughly!!

I\'m at a loss to imagine what you really\ndo mean, though.\n\n\n      Wrong point. The age of the universe has no direct effect on\nhumanity\'s sticking power, in the way the moral system of a society can\nhave.\n\n      I\'m saying the Universe has a "real age", because I see evidence\nfor it; cosmology, astronomy and so on. I say this age is independent of\npeople\'s opinions of it, because I know different people have a lot of\ndifferent opinions in the matter, yet empirical tests consistently seem\nto give roughly the same results.\n\n\n      I can\'t see how it does that. Put a creationist to the task of\nperforming the tests and calculations, see to it (s)he makes no blatant\nerrors in measuring or calculating, and the result of the test will be\nthe same.\n\n\n      Because logically consistent empirical tests contradict their\nopinion. If those tests were just my opinion, then their own tests\n(which would then be their opinion) would contradict mine, even if we\nconducted said tests in identical manner, no? They don\'t, which I take\nas showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them.\n\n\n      Map the activity of nerves and neural activity, if you mean\nphysical pain. You have a sharp point, I\'ll give you that; but you still\nhaven\'t given me a way to quantify morality.\n\n\n      We agree. Hypotheses, however, can change; I hold that there is no\n"ultimate hypothesis of morality" towards which these changes could\ngravitate, but that they could be changed in any way imaginable,\nproducing different results suitable for different tasks or purposes.\n\n\n      "Better" and "worse" are (almost?) always defined in the context\nof a moral system. Your prediction will _always_ be correct, *within*\n*that* *moral* *system*. What you need now is an objective definition of\n"good" and "bad"; I wish you luck.\n\n\n      Isn\'t that what _you\'re_ doing, when assuming an "objectively\nreal" morality? Besides, what _exactly_ is provably wrong with my\nstatement?\n\n\n      Claiming there is no objective morality is suddenly a positive\nclaim? Besides, I think I _can_ lend some credence to my claim; ponder\ndifferent individuals, both fully functional as human beings and members\nof society, but yet with wildly different moral codes. If morality was\n"objective", at least one should be way off base, but yet hir\n\'incorrect\' morality seems to function fine. How come?\n\n      As for producing these individuals, it might be easiest to pick\nthem from different societies; say, an islamic one and some polynesian\nmatrilineal system, for example (if such still exist).\n\n[ deletia - testing for footballs on desks ]\n\n\n      One thing is "good" under some circumstances, because we wish to\nachieve some goal, for some reason.

Your reasoning, as I see it, is very much along the\nlines of Roger Penrose, who claimed that mathematical \'insight\' cannot\nbe algorithmic in his book _The emperor\'s new mind: Concerning\ncomputers, minds, and the laws of physics_. However, Penrose\'s\nclaim that he _has_ mathematical insight, or your similar claim\nthat wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look,\ncould be just illusions.\n\nWe are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints - I try to ponder\non the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective,\nrealising that it might not be anything special, but certainly\nuseful. Thinking back of what I wrote, do you think worms have minds\nor not? They are able to experience pain, at least they behave \njust like that. Yet it is conceivable that we might some day\nin the future perform a "total synthesis of C. elegans" from\nthe elements. Would such a worm have a mind?\n\n\nThis is true to some extent. However, I do not think that our brains\nwork like computers, at all. In fact, there is substantial evidence\n(Skarda, 1985; Skarda & Freeman 1987) that brains work more or less\nchaotically, generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve.\nOur brains work much like genetic algorithm generators, I suppose.\n\n\nIndeed, this is extremely unlikely, given the vast impact of nurture\non our mind and brain. I suggest, however, that before trying to\nunderstand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms. \n\nKevin, take a look at the references I mentioned, and think again.\nI still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind\nare neurologists, neuropsychologists and biologists (but do not \nflame me for my opinions), since they study beings that are\nconscious. \n\nThe reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot\nlead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different.\n\nAnd please, do not bring QM into this discussion at all - not\nall physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness\nplays some special role in physics. I would say it doesn\'t.\n\n\nAgain, _brains are not computers_. Don\'t forget this. This does not\nmean they need something else to work - they just work differently.\nTheir primary \'purpose\' is perception and guidance of action, \nself-awareness and high intelligence are later appearances.\n\n\nYou are still expecting that we could find the idea of \'green\' in\nour brains somewhere, perhaps in the form of some chemical. This is\nnot how I see it. The sensation \'green\' is a certain time-dependent\npattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex, and it is distributed\nwith the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain. \n\nIndeed, a firing pattern. I have sometimes thought of our consciousness\nas a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns,\nbut this is just idle speculation.\n\nScientific American\'s September 1992 issue was a special issue on\nmind and brain. Have you already read it from cover to cover? ;-)\nThere are two articles on visual perception, so you might be \ninterested.\n\nBut again, please note that subjective experiences cannot be \nobserved from a third-person perspective. If we see nothing but \nneuronal activity, we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the\nmind.\n\nKalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation\nof different areas of brain have led to various changes in the \npatients\' state of mind. For instance, a patient whose septal area\nwas stimulated (without his knowledge) by remote control during\na psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression, and\nstarted discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend.\n\nStimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing\nsituations, when the patients have started flirting with the\ntherapist.\n\nIn conclusion, there is evidence that\n\n1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences, \n   brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage\n\n2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in\n   various areas of brain - when we think of colours, our\n   visual cortex is activated etc.\n\n3) consciousness is an afterthought - we become conscious of our\n   actions with a half a second delay, and our brains are ahead\n   of our \'conscious will\' by at least 350 ms. \n\nThus, I think it is fruitful to turn the question "Why do \'I\' see\ncolours" around and ask "What is this \'I\' that seems to be \nobserving?", since it seems that our conscious mind is not\nthe king of our brains.\n\n\nThis depends on what is meant by \'seeing colours\'. Does a neural\nnetwork that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from\n0 to 9 see the numbers, if it is capable of sorting them?\n\nIf you are asking, "why does an animal who is conscious of itself\nas an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who\ndoesn\'t", I have a good answer - read my previous posting,\nwhere I wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap\nroles and act more morally, so that they don\'t unconsciously\nkill each other with newly discovered weapons. (A bit extreme,\nbut this is the basic idea.)\n\nWhen early _Homo_ became more and more efficient in using tools, \na sense of identity and the concept of \'self\' had to evolve in\nline with this development. Indeed, respect for others and \nconscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages\nfor social animals, such as early humans. \n\n\nIf minds are required for this, does this mean that until human\nminds came to the scene, wavefunctions never collapsed, but remained\nin the superpositions for aeons? My, how powerful we are.\n\nThis has been discussed before, and I think this topic is irrelevant,\nsince we do not agree that minds are necessary, and neither do\nphysicists. \n\n\nI agree, but not in the sense you apparently mean above - physics\nneeds sharp minds to solve many real problems. ;-)\n\n\nIt\'s OK, if you don\'t forget to take with you the references I\nwrote about in my previous posting, plus the following:\n\nKalat, James W.

Thanks.\n', "\n\n\nFor those of you who read TV Guide, there's an article in next week's\nSPORTSVIEW concerning the NHL and major network broadcasting. Pretty\ninteresting.", 'Perhaps it\'s prophetic that the week "Where are they now?" appears and\nI can claim to be a still-active old-timer, my news software gets bit\nrot and ships outgoing articles into a deep hole somewhere...  Anyway,\nhere\'s a repost:\n\n\nThese days you don\'t have to fall far behind... Last Monday\n(admittedly after a long weekend, but...) I had 800+ messages just in\nthose few days.  Aside from a hiatus while changing jobs last Fall\nI\'ve been here since 1990.\n\n\nHell, Norway?  The rubber room at the funny farm?  Seminary?  It is\nnot given to us to know...', '\nI read it when it first came out, and the controversy broke. Put my name\non the waiting list at the library (that way if the book was really\noffensive, none of my money would find its way to the author or\npublisher), and read it, "cover to cover" (to use a phrase that seems\npopular here right now).\n\nAnd I *liked* it. The writing style was a little hard to get used to, but\nit was well worth the effort. Coming from a similar background (Rushdie\ngrew up in Bombay in a muslim family, and moved to England; I grew up in\nNew Delhi), it made a strong impression on me.  (And he used many of the\nstrange constructions of Indian English: the "yaar" at the end of a\nsentence, "Butbutbut," the occasional hindi phrase, etc.)\n\nAt the time I still "sorta-kinda" thought of myself as a muslim, and I\ncouldn\'t see what the flap was all about. It seemed clear to me that this\nwas allegory.  It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who\ntook on the names and personae of Muhammed\'s wives, and had not (as my\ngrandfather thundered) implied that Muhammed\'s wives were prostitutes; in\nshort, every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to\nhave missed the point completely.  (And I won\'t mention the fact that the\nmost militant of them had never even seen the book. Oops, I just did!)\n\nPerhaps in a deep sense, the book is insulting to Islam, because it\nexposes the silliness of revealed religion - why does an omnipotent deity\nneed an agent? She can come directly to me, can\'t she? How do we know that\nMuhammed didn\'t just go out into the desert and smoke something? And how\ndo we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn\'t screw up, or\nput in their own little verses? And why can Muhammed marry more than four\nwomen, when no other muslim is allowed to? (Although I think the biggest\ninsult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to\nsuppress a book, sight unseen, on the say-so of some "holy" guy. Not to\nmention murder the author.)\n\n\nI had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book. A really\nsilly argument - after all, how many of these same people have read "Mein\nKampf?" It just made me wonder - what are they afraid of? Why don\'t they\njust read the book and decide for themselves?\n\nMaybe the reaction of the muslim community to the book, and the absence of\nprotest from the "liberal" muslims to Khomeini\'s fatwa outrage, was the\nfinal push I needed into atheism!\n\n-s', '\n\nDiplomatic :-)\n\nI realize I\'m fighting Occam\'s razor in this argument, so I\'ll try to\nexplain why I feel a mind is necessary. \n\nFirstly, I\'m not impressed with the ability of algorithms. They\'re\ngreat at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not\nat working out the method itself.\n\nAs a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the\nsimple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do\nthese with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks.\nNow, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but\nin doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program\nthem into the computer. You can, of course, \'obfuscate\' the trick, and\nwrite the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see,\nthe trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does\nthis mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already\npre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that\nour brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic\nmaterial, much of which isn\'t used.\n\nOne way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but\n(again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of \'if you see\nobject X, then perform action Y,\' and we don\'t seem to get anywhere.\nThe algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what\nconclusions to draw from it\'s experience.\n\nThe other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many\nalgorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet\npeople survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are\nside-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also,\nneurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -\ncan an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it\'s\ncode?\n\nThe next problem is the sticky question of "What is colour?" (replace\n\'colour\' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the\nmaterialist viewpoint is that it\'s the product of some kind of\nchemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +\ndifferent chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a\ncomputer won\'t see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an\nalgorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an\nequivalent that doesn\'t? It shouldn\'t, because the outputs of each\nalgorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do\nwe see colour?\n\n\n\nA bit of idle speculation...\n\nIf I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\nwith two processes acting on it. The first process has been called\n\'Unitary Evolution\' (or \'U\'), is governed by Schroedinger\'s equation\nand is well known. The second process, called various things such as\n\'collapse of the wavefunction\' or \'state vector reduction\' (or \'R\'),\nand is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a\n\'measurement\' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely\nwhen that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly\nchange the wavefunction.\n\nI envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and \'something\nelse,\' which I shall imaginitively call \'part X.\' It seems reasonable\nto assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be\nthe wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the\nwavefunction. Note, though, that we\'d need more than U to explain R.)\n\nAnyway, I\'m speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to\nbe some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear\nsuperpositions of anything, although there are alternative\nexplainations for this. I\'ve no idea how a brain is supposed to access\npart X, but since this is only speculation, that won\'t matter too\nmuch :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in\nphysics.\n\nI\'ll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that\'s OK with you :-)\n\n\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKevin Anthoney                                         kax@cs.nott.ac.uk\n            Don\'t believe anything you read in .sig files.', 'I guess I\'m delving into a religious language area.

It\'s\nentirely another to say, "Okay, let\'s take a team from a thriving hockey town\nand move it!" \n\nOf course, none of us will ever know the real inside story, but\nfrom what I know, a group of Minneapolis businessmen told Green repeatedly that\nthey would purchase the remaining 3600 (?) season tickets to get to the 10,000\nlevel that Green wanted, yet he refused every time.

The individual\'s belief in some dogmatic religion is a \nsymptom of that irrationality.\n\n\nAtheists and agnostics, I would imagine, but yes, that was my point.  An\natheist would theoretically be just as ill-equipped to study the philosophy\nof religion as a Christian, and yet there is a persistence of atheists\namong the ranks of philosophers.  Therefore, the conflict between one\'s\nreligious beliefs (or lack thereof) and the ability to be a philosopher\nmust not be as great as you assert.  The fact that most philosophers may\nbe non-religious was a secondary point.\n\n\n\nAs opposed to science practiced by theists?  Be careful here.\n\nScience does have a built-in defence against faith and dogma:\nskepticism.  Unfortunately, it is not foolproof.  There is that \nwonderful little creature known as the "theory."

There is quite a bit of faith involved here.\n\n\n\nWell, not ALL current beliefs are deficient, but basically I agree.\n\n\n\nIdeally, this is true.  In reality, though, you have to acknowledge\nthat scientists are human.  Scientists have egos and biases.  Some\nscientists assume a particular theory is true, refuse to admit the\nflaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever, and proceed\nto spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof \nfor the theory.  Remember cold fusion?\n\n\n\nNot really.  I agree that we spent far too much money on the Waco\ncrisis ($7,500,000 I believe), especially considering the outcome.\nMy point was that mass suicides in the U.S. are rare (Jonestown was\nin Guyana, incidentally, although we footed the bill for the clean-up),\nand the U.S. has far more important issues to address.

He virtually stole games 1 and 3 for the Sabres.\nIn both of these games, Fuhr stood on his head to give the Sabres\nthe chance to win. Especially in game 3, Fuhr made a series of\nhuge stops in the third period when the score was tied 2-2. \nEven in game 2 when the Sabres won 4-0, the score seemed to\nindicate that the Sabres dominated. However, if it hadn't been\nfor Fuhr, the Sabres wouldn't have been up (2-0 I think it was)\nthrough the 2nd period and the Bruins wouldn't have had to open\nup the game (thereby allowing Mogilny to score the third goal on\na breakaway to salt away the game).

The Sabres did get\nextraordinary efforts from Hannan, Sweeney, Wood, and Khmylev\n(compared to that of the Bruins checkers). However, the Bruins defense\n, IMO, played better than the Sabres defense (the Sabres have Ken Sutton\nplaying a regular shift afterall ;-)\nThe difference in the series was Fuhr, who outplayed Andy Moog. \n\nGary", '\n\n\n\n\n\nLori, the regular Penguins poster here on rec.sport.hockey, indicated to me\nvia e-mail that on the nights that Pirates baseball and Penguins playoff \ngames coincide, the Pens will be covered on WDVE FM (102.5).', "\tThe Sharks appear to be leaning toward picking Rob\n\tNiedermayer, a center (his brother Scott (?) is a defenseman\n\tpicked by NJ a couple years ago).

From what I have read\n\tNiedermayer is the best skater in the draft, plays BOTH\n\toffense and defense, and isn't afraid of physical play.\n\tDefensively the Sharks are looking pretty good in terms of\n\tdefense prospects (Rathje, Sykora, Ragnarsson), and our\n\tcenters (Kisio et al) are getting old.\n\n\tWith all of the small players the Sharks have I justs CAN't\n\tsee them picking yet another small player like Kariya, he'd\n\tjust get bashed by the oppposition and get a separated \n\tshoulder.", "News:\n=====\nFor the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only player\nremaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not \na major part of the team. \n\nTrent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season\ngame against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and has\nalso scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles. \n\nThoughts on Game 1:\n==================\n\nThe Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with\nLos Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing\nbig hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but that\nwas the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and \ntry and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky\nKings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames\nconducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren\nFleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren\nRychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. \n\nGoaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the\nloss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got\nvery little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and \nsweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off\nChris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net. \n\nThoughts on Game 2:\n==================\n\nThe Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the\npotentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.\nThe first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary\ncame out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoring\nfive goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. \n\nThe deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary\ndominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make better\nuse of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary\nalso went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up\na shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in the\ngame with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them when\nthey needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. \n\nThe Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he\nwas leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. Charlie\nHuddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. \n\nThe game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube of\nCalgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for\ninstigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato\ndrew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed\n30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct\nfor hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a\nfight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and\nYawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil \nturtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at \neach other was just roughing?

As for the four gospels being in harmony\non the issue of Jesus...  You know not of what you speak.  Here are a few\ncontradictions starting with the trial and continuing through the assension.\n\n\nActs 1:18: "Now this man (Judas) purchased a field with the reward of \niniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his \nbowels gushed out."\n\nMatt. 27:5-7: "And he (Judas) cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, \nand departed, and went and hanged himself.

And Peter called to mind  the \nword  that  Jesus  said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny\nme thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.\n\nMAT 26:74  Then began he to curse and to swear,  saying,  I  know not the man.\nAnd immediately the cock crew.\nMAT 26:75  And Peter remembered the word  of  Jesus,  which  said unto him,\nBefore the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept\nbitterly.\n\nLUK 22:60  And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest.  And immediately,\nwhile he yet spake, the cock crew.\nLUK 22:61  And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And  Peter remembered\nthe word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou\nshalt deny me thrice.\n\nJOH 13:38  Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? \nVerily,\n verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, still thou hast denied me\nthrice.\n\nJOH 18:27  Peter then denied  again:  and  immediately  the  cock crew.\n\n\n(This is interesting because Matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made! \nNot the only time he does this either...)\n\nMAT 27:9  Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy  the prophet, \nsaying,  And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was\nvalued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;\n\nzechariah 11:11-13\n(nothing in Jeremiah remotely like)\n\nWhat was the color of the robe placed on Jesus during his trial?\n\nscarlet - Matthew 27:28\n\npurple John 19:2\n\n\nMark says the third hour, or 9 a.m., but John says the sixth hour (noon) was\nwhen the sentence was passed.\n\n\nMatthew  --  This is Jesus the king of the Jews\nMark\t --  The King of the Jews\nLuke\t --  This is the king of the Jews\nJohn\t --  Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews\n\n\nvinegar - Matthew 27:34\n\nwine with myrrh - Mark 15:23\n\n\nMatthew said many stood far off, including Mary Magdaline, Mary the mother of\nJames, and the mother of Zebedee\'s children.  Mark and Luke speak of many far\noff, and Mark includes Mary Magdeline and Mary the mother of James the less.\nJohn says that Jesus\'s mother stood at the cross, along with her sister and\nMary Magdalene.\n\n\nMatt.27:46,50: "And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, \nsaying, "Eli, eli, lama sabachthani?" that is to say, "My God, my God, why\nhast thou forsaken me?"  ...Jesus, when he cried again with a loud voice,\nyielded u the ghost."\n\nLuke23:46: "And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, "Father, unto\n thy hands I commend my spirit:" and having said thus, he gave up the ghost."\n\nJohn19:30: "When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, "It is \nfinished:" and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost."\n\n\nMatthew says that the veil of the temple was rent, that there was an\nearthquake, and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour, that graves\nopened and bodies of the saints arose and went into Jeruselem, appearing to\nmany (beating Jesus to the resurection). Mark and Luke speak of darkness and\nthe veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints. \nJohn is the only one who mentions Jesus\'s side being peirced.\n\n\nMatthew says the Jews asked Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being\nstolen by the disciples, and for the tomb to be sealed. All of this was\nsupposedly done, but the other gospels do not mention these precautions.\n\nDepends where you look; Matthew 12:40 gives Jesus prophesying that he will\nspend "three days and three nights in the heart of the earth", and Mark 10:34\nhas "after three days (meta treis emeras) he will rise again". As far as I can\nsee from a quick look, the prophecies have "after three days", but the\npost-resurrection narratives have "on the third day".\n\n\nMatthew says Sunday at dawn, Mark says the sun was rising, and John says it\nwas dark.\n\n\nMAT 28:1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to  dawn  toward the first\nday of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.\n\nMAR 16:1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the  mother \nof  James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and\nanoint him.\n\nJOH 20:1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early, when  it \nwas  yet  dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the\nsepulchre.\n\n\nMAT 28:2  And, behold, there was  a  great  earthquake:  for  the angel of the\nLord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door,\nand sat upon it.\nMAT 28:3  His countenance was like  lightning,  and  his  raiment white as\nsnow: MAT 28:4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake,  and  became as\ndead men. MAT 28:5  And the angel answered and said unto  the  women,  Fear\nnot ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.\n\nMAR 16:5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a  young  man sitting  on \nthe right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.\n\nLUK 24:4  And it came  to  pass,  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout,\nbehold, two men stood by them in shining garments:\n\nJOH 20:12  And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at  the head,  and \nthe  other  at  the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.\n\n\nMatthew says the guard was paid to tell this story, but no other gospel makes\nthis claim.\n\n\nMatthew says an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also told\nthem, to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.  The disciples then went\nto a mountain previously agreed opon, and met Jesus there.  This was his only\nappearance, except to the women at the tomb.  Matthew only devotes five verses\nto the visit with the disciples.\n\nMark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country, and that\nthey told the rest of the disciples, who refused to believe.  Later he\nappeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.\n\nLuke says two followers went, the same day that Jesus rose from the dead, to\nEmmaus, a village eight miles from Jeruselem, and there Jesus jioned them but\nwas unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening, they finally\nrecognised Jesus, whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem,\nthey told the\ndisciples of their experience, and suddenly Jesus appeared among them,\nfrightening them, as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fish\nand honey and then preached to them.\n\nJohn says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose, in\nJeruselem, where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them, but\nThomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joined\nthe disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.\tOnce\nmore Jesus made an\nappearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not\nrecognised.\n After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat, Jesus\nbecomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eat\ntogether and converse.\n\nThe book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showed\nhimself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thus\ncontradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke AND John) and spoke to them of things\npertaining to the kingdom of God: "And when he had spoken these things, while\nthey beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight. \nAnd while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, two men stood\nby them in white apparel: Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye\ngazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken from you into heaven,\nshall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven" Acts 1:3-11\n\nPaul outdoes every other "authority" by saying that Jesus was seen by 500\npersons between the time of the resurection and the\nassension, although he does not say where.\tHe also claims that he himself "as\none born out of due time" also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.\n\n\nMatthew says nothing about it.\tMark casually says that Jesus was recieved into\nheaven after he was finished talking with the\ndisciples in Jeruselem.  Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and that\nwhile he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven. \nJohn says nothing about it.  Acts\ncontradicts all of the above.  (See previous section)\n\n\nMAT 24:34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all\nthese things be fulfilled.\n\nMAR 13:30  Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall  not pass, till\nall these things be done.\n\nLUK 21:32  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not  pass away, till\nall be fulfilled.\n\n1 thessalonians 4:15-18\n\n1 Corinthians 15:5 (12)\nMatthew 27:3-5 (minus one from 12)\nActs 1:9-26 (Mathias not elected until after resurrection)\nMAT 28:16  Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain\nwhere Jesus had appointed them.\n\n\t"And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven." (2 Kings 2:11)\n\n\t"No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, \t...\nthe Son of Man." (John 3:13)\n\nAs you can see, there are a number of contradictions in the account of the\ntrial, crucifiction and resurection of Jesus.  If these are good witnesses,\nyou would think that they could get SOME of these important details right! \n(In fact, I cannot find very many points on where they AGREE.  You would think\nthat they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly\nobserving!) Because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error,\nthe story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth.\n(Due to the nature of the story, I doubt if it should be taken as ANY sort of\ntruth.)', "\nWell, Your Majesty, ;^), couldn't you just picture it?

People were\ncheering the Blues long before face-off time, and they kept going for the\nentire game. My friends and I went out celebrating until the early morning\nhours with some of the players. Here\'s a game summary from the St. Louis\nPost-Disptach. Enjoy...\n\nBy Dave Luecking\nOf The Post-Dispatch Staff:\n\nAt 10:24 p.m. Friday night, The Arena crowd of 17,965 paid homage to Blues\ngoalie Curtis Joseph. The fans began bowing, their arms extended, taking the\nthe lead from a fan who held a sign that read ``Only God Saves More Than\nJoseph."  It was a fitting tribute to Joseph, who has brought the Blues to\nthe verge of a surprising sweep.\n\nJoseph recorded his second successive shutout Friday, blanking the Blackhawks\n3-0 in Game 3 of the Norris Division semifinals and giving the Blues a 3-0\nlead in the best-of-seven series.\n\nThe Blackhawks haven\'t scored against Joseph since the 8:51 mark of the second\nperiod of Game 1. Joseph has shut out the Blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds,\na Blues record. Jacques Plante held the previous record of 146:28, set in the\nfirst round of the 1969 playoffs against the Philadelphia Flyers, one of only\ntwo series the Blues have sweeped in their history.\n\nThe Blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in Game 4,\na nationally televised game that begins at noon Sunday. The Blues have had\nonly two sweeps in franchise history, both in 1969, when they swept\nPhiladelphia and Los Angeles en route to the Stanley Cup finals.\n\nThe shutout Friday was easier than on Wednesday in Game 2 when Joseph had to\nmake 47 saves. This time, the Blues held the shots down to 34, and the\nBlackhawks couldn\'t touch Joseph.\n\nWell, they touched Joseph, numerous times, shoving him and pushing him at \nevery opportunity to try to get him off his game. But Joseph and the Blues\nwere unfazed, dishing out their own punishment along the way.\n\nThe Blues\' grinders -- Bob Bassen, Rich Sutter, Kevin Miller and Dave Lowry --\nwore down the Blackhawks, taking the visitors from Chicago off their game.\nThe grinders set the stage for the glamour boys, the gifted playmakers and\nscorers, who made the most of their opportunities.\n\nCraig Janney, Brett Hull and Nelson Emerson scored, getting one goal in each\nperiod. Hull assisted on Janney\'s first-period power play goal after two unwise\nChicago penalties. Checker Miller set up Hull\'s goal in the second period, and\nrookie Denny Felsner assisted for Emerson, who scored at 16:44 of the final \nperiod.\n\nBlues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling\n``Sweep. Sweep. Sweep." They also taunted Chicago goalie Ed Belfour \n``Bell-Four. Bell-Four." They also chanted ``Na, na-na-na, hey-hey good bye."\n\nSuch talk is a tad premature. There\'s still one game left, but the Blues are\non a roll. They have the Blackhawks on their heels.\n\nThe Blues set the tone early on Friday with two crunching hits in the first\nminute of play. Rich Sutter leveled Bryan Marchment, and Brendan Shanahan\ndumped Steve Smith at center ice.\n\nChicago tried to retaliate, but Troy Murray\'s decision to run into Joseph\nbackfired. Referee Dan Marouelli gave him a roughing penalty.\n\nThe Blues didn\'t get a shot on goal on the power play, and they survived a\nscare after Chicago killed the penalty when Rick Zombo gave the puck away to\nSteve Larmer. Joseph stopped Larmer\'s shot and everything else Chicago threw\nat him in the first period. The \'Hawks ignored the scouting report on Joseph\nabout shooting high and continued to shoot low, where Joseph\'s butterfly\nstyle is deadly.\n\nRookie Bret Hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the\nperiod -- two for hooking and one for holding -- but Chicago got only two\nshots on goal, as many as Miller. The Blues\' penalty killer twice stole the\npuck and just missed on good scoring chances against Belfour.\n \nMarouelli began calling penalties on the Blackhawks to even things up.\nHe caught Brent Sutter hooking Shanahan four seconds after Hedican\'s third\npenalty. He called Marchment for elbowing Janney along the boards at 14:58,\nand gave the Blues a two-man advantage 1:07 later when Christian Ruuttu\nslashed Shanahan.\n\nThe Blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play, and Hull got it\nwhere he likes it -- in the high slot. Hull\'s shot hit Belfour\'s right\nshoulder, and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line. Belfour\ndived back to cover, but the puck squirted loose to Janney, who poked it into\nthe net at 16:53 for his first goal of the playoffs.\n\nThe Blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended, and the\nBlackhawks lost their composure. Joe Murphy tripped Ron Wilson with two seconds\nremaining in the period, and after time had expired Smith upset the Blues by\nshooting the puck into the Blues\' bench.\n\nChris Chelios made a move toward Joseph as the teams left the ice, and\nMarouelli slapped him with a 10-minute misconduct. Chicago survived the Blues\'\npower play, but the loss of Chelios hurt. He didn\'t return until the midway\npoint of the period, and within three minutes of his return, Hull had increased\nthe Blues\' lead to 2-0, deflecting in Miller\'s crisp pass.\n\nTry as they might, the Blackhawks couldn\'t get to Joseph, who stopped\neverything they could throw at him. He stopped 12 shots in the second period\nand 13 more in the third. Chicago also hit the goalpost twice.\n\nEmerson\'s goal put the game away. He went hard to the net and redirected\nFelsner\'s pass.', 'In <1993Apr21.211038.12363@newshub.ists.ca> dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca\n\n', "\nIf my powerplay was as bad as Montreal's, I'd be thanking Stewart for calling\nas few penalties as possible.

The Christian Bible says that one may kill\n#under certain circumstances.   In fact, it instructs one to kill under\n#certain circumstances.     \n\nI\'d say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them\nto kill under certain circumstances.  I do get your distinction between\nmotivate and allow, and I do agree that if a flavour of theism \'allows\'\natoricities, then that\'s an indictment of that theism.  But it rather\ndepends on what the \'certain circumstances\' are.  When you talk about\nChristianity, or Islam, then at least your claims can be understood.\nIt\'s when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls\napart.  One could believe in a God which instructs one to be utterly\nharmless.\n#\n#|> For my part, I conclude that something\n#|> else is required.  I also happen to believe that that something\n#|> else will work no less well without religion - any easy Them/Us will\n#|> do.\n#\n#And what does religion supply, if not an easy Them/Us?\n\nNot necessarily.  "Love thy neighbour" does not supply a them/us - it\ndemolishes it.

If they were doing it because of some obscure\npoint of theology, then yes.  But since all protestants don\'t do this\n(nor do they elect extremists to do it for them), it\'s just too broad\ntoo say "religion did this".  I\'m saying that the causes are far more\ncomplex than that - take away the religious element, and you\'d still\nhave the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism.

Anyone know there telephone # in Bristol, Ct?  \n\nI do find it hard to believe that ESPN doesn't think viewers will simply\nchange the channel from a boring game....I know I did.  And then, when\nthey didn't show the NYI-Wash overtime(s), I was livid!  If I wanted\nto watch baseball, I could have turned on the Phillies-Padres extra\ninning game....instead, I went to bed angry......I boycotted ESPN's\nmorning Sportscenter today, I was still so incensed.\n\nMy wife says I shouldn't go to bed angry, but last nite.........GRRRRRRR!\n\n ", '[...stuff deleted...]\n\nThank you.

Finally they showed a highlight of the OT goal but that\n   was like 30 sec.

This\nwas a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of the\ncharacters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix the\nCat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc.\n\nRon Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs\ngame. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players "They\nwon in their building, we\'re going to win in ours".\n\nDon then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour\nhas never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he\ngot 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims that\nhe gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible\nfor his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour\nfrom the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk\nresulting in a goal.\n\nOn the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in\nthe first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed\nhowever, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells\nthe Leaf players "Don\'t let them score on you".\n\nRon brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal\nwon that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner\ndisqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don\nthought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of\ninstant replay.\n\nOn the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning\nthe series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr.\nFuhr should be getting 1/2 the team\'s playoff checks for his\nplay.\n\nWendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance\nduring the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying\nthat he can\'t play the way he should, because of the league\'s\nnew rules. "This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its\nall hack and slash." Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the\nproblems.\n\nDon\'s opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings\nGM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray\nwas shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination\nof fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article\nin which Murray makes the following statements: "Players don\'t fight\nbecause they\'re afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator.\nInstead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing\neach other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there\nwouldn\'t be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game."\n\nDon warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to "smarten up" with\nfighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used\nto be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights,\nsomeone gets cut every period.\n\nRating\n------\nTypical anti-fighting posturing, but here Don\'s opinion is supported\nby Murray.', "\nI bought a copy of The Satanic Verses when there was talk of the British\nGovernment banning it.

I\'m reposting it\njust so Bill doesn\'t think I\'m ignoring him.\n\n\nBill,\n\nI\'m sorry to have been busy lately and only just be getting around to\nthis.\n\nApparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism; I think\nmany of these are well addressed in the famous FAQ.  Your generalisms\nare then misplaced -- atheism needn\'t imply materialism, or the lack\nof an absolute moral system.  However, I do tend to materialism and\ndon\'t believe in absolute morality, so I\'ll answer your questions.\n\n\nAn atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does: according\nto a personal understanding of morality.  That I don\'t believe in an\nabsolute one doesn\'t mean that I don\'t have one.  I\'m just explicit,\nas in the line of postings you followed up, that when I express\njudgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code\nrather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad.\nMy moral code is not particular different from that of others around\nme, be they Christians, Muslims, or atheists.  So when I say that I\nobject to genocide, I\'m not expressing anything particularly out of\nline with what my society holds.\n\nIf your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it\ndoes, my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moral\ncode is a prerequisite for a functioning society, and that humanity\nprobably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of\nour ability to exist in large societies, thereby achieving\nconsiderable survival advantages.  You\'d probably say that God just\nmade the rules.  Neither of us can convince the other, but we share a\ncommon understanding about many moral issues.  You think you get it\nfrom your religion, I think I get it (and you get it) from early\nchildhood teaching.\n\n\nI think you\'ve been reading the wrong sort of comic books, but in\nprying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you\'re\nsaying.  I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as "God\ncommanded the genocide of the Canaanites" is mechanistic, but of\ncourse I think that\'s true of you as well.  My reaction has little to\ndo with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does, but\nif a god existed who commanded genocide, I could not consider him\ngood, which is supposedly an attribute of God.\n\n\nHmm.  Yes, I think some heavy FAQ-reading would do you some good.  I\nhave as much place discussing values etc. as any other person.  In\nfact, I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion, by\nframing the questions in terms of reason: for instance, it is clear\nthat in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt\nto wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands, then the\nquality of life will be generally poor, so a system that fosters\ncoexistence is superior, if quality of life is an agreed goal.  An\nabsolutist, on the other hand, can only thump those portions of a\nBible they happen to agree with, and say "this is good", even if the\nact in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in\nthe discussion.  The attempt to define someone or a group of people as\n"excluded from discussion", such that they "cannot participate", and\ntheir opinions given "no weight whatsoever" is the lowest form or\nreasoning (ad hominem/poisoning the well), and presumably the resort\nof someone who can\'t rationally defend their own ideas of right,\nwrong, and the Bible.\n-- \nJim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC\nThese are my opinions.

The Jets\nlooked more dangerous in this one but it didn't make a difference in the \nnumbers that counted: goals.\n\tVancouver's big line produced again, with centre Cliff Ronning and\nleft winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to \nboost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of\nBautin and Ulanov. Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent\nin opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals.\n\tHowever, as in the first game, the Jets worked hard to take the\ngame to the Canucks in the second period. The Jets dominated the second,\nchecking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged\nby a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early. \n\tThe hard work paid off late in the second, when Tie Domi caught\nVancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make\nthe score 2-1. \n\tDomi's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush\nto the Canuck's collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do \nanything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets were\nallowed to set up and make plays.\n\tBoth goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably.\nMcLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne\nwhile Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerous\non the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck\nzone. The Canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering four\nchecking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead.\n\tA series of minor penalties at the end of the second period\nresulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. The\nJet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's\nlegs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2.\n\tThe Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off.\nThis was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected\nor were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight\nWinnipeg defence that were never supported.\n\tHowever, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensive\nlapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff\nin the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with\nno Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in the\ngame up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a \nbackhand even though he was off balance. \n\tBy then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made it\nto the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing\nfor their attack.

They believed Koresh was a prophet, and therefore believed\neverything he said.  The problem wasn\'t the religion, it was the \nfollowers.  They didn\'t die because of faith and dogma, they died because\nof their zealotry (or, in the case of the children, the zealotry of their\nparents).\n\n\nSo Christians are totally irrational?  Irrational with respect to their\nreligion only?  What are you saying?  One\'s belief in a Christian God does\nnot make one totally irrational.  I think I know what you were getting at,\nbut I\'d rather hear you expand on the subject.\n\n\n\nAgain, this statement is too general.  A Christian is perfectly capable of\nbeing a philosopher, and absolutely capable of changing his/her mind.  Faith in\nGod is a belief, and all beliefs may change.  Would you assert that atheists\nwould make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a\nGod which, of course, may show unfair bias when studying, say, religion?\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, Christianity is a prison, eh?  Ever heard of parole?  You have read far\ntoo much into this subject.  A Christian is one who follows the religion\nbased on the teachings of a man named Jesus Christ.  Nowhere does this\ndefinition imply that one cannot change one\'s mind.  In prison, however,\nyou can\'t just decide to leave.  One is voluntary, the other is not.

Last night in the\n    3rd game between NJ and Pitt, he was being pushed while skating across the\n    front of the goal while trying to get a shot off.  The guy on him was\n    doing a good job, so he got off a weak shot, but then he decided to fall\n    to the ice. Then the fucking ref(Van Helloamend?) called the guy for\n    holding.  They replayed the play, and my roomate(who is clueless about\n    hockey) wanted to know what the NJ guy did to get a call, because it was so fucking obvious the NJ player\n    had both hands on his stick, and no, he did not trip him.  It is simple,\n    Mario gets touched, he falls to the ice, automatic 2.  But the thing that\n    really pissed me off is, Pitt scored the 3rd or 4th goal, I don't remember,\n    on the resulting PP and\n    eventually won 4-3.

The Bible is\nhopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. God did\nnot answer. In the end, I found I had been following a mass delusion,\na lie. I can't believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint\nof her existence.\n\n\nI suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe\nand analyse their position. In fact, it is amusing to note in this\ncontext that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the\nopposite - one should not examine one's belief critically.\n\nI'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony' I posted to this\ngroup two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over,\nI decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional\nresponses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only\na couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works,\nthank god, just to think about it again when I hung up.

I _hated_ experiments\nlike this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student's workload\nconsiderably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my first\nattempt. However, I think I'll never forget the lesson: \n\nNo matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X,\nit may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take\na leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent. \nBut it can still be wrong. \n\nI found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism\nto believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear, \nfiltering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god\nplaying any part. \n\n\nOh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better\ndocumented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented\nquite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too\nmuch attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of\nthe gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance,\nthe end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.\n\nJesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.\n\n\nThis is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind,\nand that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I\nobserve. Nothing else need to be taken on faith, I will go by the\nevidence. \n\nIt makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not.\nI assume that he did, considering the vast amount of evidence presented.\n\n\nA liar, how do you know what my attitude was? Try reading your Bible\nagain. \n\nI was willing to die for my faith. Those who do are usually remembered\nas heroes, at least among those who believe. Dan, do you think I'm\nlying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years? It seems it is \nvery difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not\ndo so anymore. But I can't go on lying to myself.\n\nBlind trust is dangerous, and I was just another blind led by the blind.\nBut if god really wants me, she'll know what to do. I'm willing.

What I am trying to say,\nin my clumsy way, is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates\nto theism making predictions (prayer, your \'Rapture\' example), I don\'t\nbuy your use of Occam\'s razor in all cases where A=0.\n\nIn my example, one couldn\'t dismiss\n[benefactor] or [bug] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary\nto explain the dosh.  I brought up the \'one-by-one dismissal\' process to\nshow that it would be wrong to do so.  From what you\'re saying in this\npost, it seems you agree, and we\'re talking at cross-purposes.\n\n#(3) is still in contradiction to (1).\n#\n#Some sums may help. With B = benefactor, b = bug, d = dosh arrives in account:\n#\n#  (1) implies  P(B+b | d) = 1\n#\n#Assuming that P(Bb | d) = 0, so it\'s either the benefactor *or* a bug\n#which is responsible if the bucks arrive, but not both, then\n#\n#   P(B+b | d)   =   P(B | d) + P(b | d)\n#\n#so\n#\n#   P(B | d) + P(b | d)  =  1\n#\n#but (3) implies that\n#\n#   P(B | d)  =  0  and  P(b | d)  =  0.\n\nNo, this isn\'t what I meant.  P(B | d) = 0.5 and P(b | d) = 0.5, with\nnecessarily no new observation (we\'ve already seen the dosh) to change\nthose estimates.  I was trying to say (again, in my clumsy way) that\nit would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these.  And that\'s\nprecisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods are\none class of hypothesis (there are many others) belonging to a set of\nhypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise \nwould _not_ be satisfactorily explained.  It can be thrown out or\nretained on grounds of non-rational preference, not of science or statistics.   \nAlternatively, one could chuck out or retain the lot, on the grounds\nthat the answer can\'t be known, or that the notional probability estimates\nare effectively useless, being equal (agnosticism/weak atheism).\n\n#> As they do when the set M is filled by "the universe is caused by x",\n#> where x is gods, pink unicorns, nothing, etc.  - and no observation\n#> tends to one conclusion over the other.\n#\n#Exactly the point I was making, I think. So we don\'t "throw out" any of\n#these, contrary to your assertion above that we do.\n\nSome people do, Simon, and they think they are doing excellent science.\nMy sole point was that they aren\'t.\n\n#>> Only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis H[i] (i.e. x\n#>> where P(x | H[i]) = 0) can cause P(H[i]) to go to zero after a finite\n#>> number of observations.

See my post on the other branch of this\n#thread.\n\nThen you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of.  If\nthe razor holds for gods, then it holds for all like hypotheses.  Which\nmeans that you\'re assigning P(x | H[i]) =0 for all i, though we\'ve already\nestablished that it\'s not correct to do so when SUM(P(x|H[i]))=1 over\nall i.\n\n#> Simply put, anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or\n#> non-existence of gods, whether inductive or no, is at best mistaken, and\n#> at worst barking mad.\n#\n#Luckily I make no such claim, and have specifically said as much on numerous\n#occasions. You wouldn\'t be constructing a strawman here, would you Frank?\n#Although that doesn\'t, of course, rule out my being barking mad in any case\n#(I could be barking mad in my spare time, with apologies to Cleese et al).\n#\n#But I think you miss the point once again. When I say that something is\n#"evidence against" an hypothesis, that doesn\'t imply that observation of\n#the said something necessarily *falsifies* the hypothesis, reducing the\n#estimate of P(H | data) to zero. If it *reduces* this quantity, it\'s still\n#evidence against H.\n\nNo, I got that.  I\'m talking about the case when A=0.  You\'re clearly\ncorrect when A!=0.   And I\'m not constructing a strawman (though it\'s\ncertainly possible that I\'ve misunderstood what you\'re saying).  However,\nby any standards, a system that says when A=0, gods are highly unlikely,\nand when A!=0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor, is a system purporting\nto be an inductive proof that gods either don\'t exist, or are unnecessary\nto explain any or all phenomena.  In my experience, systems such as this\n(including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain\na fallacy upon close examination.  If that\'s not what you\'re saying, then\nplease put me straight.', 'Stuff deleted\n\nI reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little\njustification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur\'an.\nIn Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished. \nBelief is considered a matter of conscience and since there\nis to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have\nbeen generally left to believe or not believe as they will.\n\nHowever, when an apostate makes attacks upon "God and\nHis Messenger" the situation changes. Now the charge of\napostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps \ncharges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person \nmakes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public\nattacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the\nsituation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads\nslander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation\nchanges. The punishments vary according to the situation\nthe apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated\napostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie\'s case.\n\nThere is a distinction in the Qur\'an between a formal war situation\nand being in the situation where someone unilaterally\nwages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc. \nagainst the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm \nto Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could\nbe said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is\na clear difference between a formal war situation (where two\nclearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange\nprisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated\nindividuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation, \nthe unilateral attack and the spreading of "fasad" that \nwould apply in the case of Rushdie.\n\nThe matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an \noffensive book (banning the book is secondary) -\na full set of circumstances following the publication of\nthe book come into play as well, including the deaths of many\nMuslims, and Rushdie\'s (and his publishers) Media games.\n\n\n\n\nI am not sure which hadith you are referring to above. I believe\nthat one of the Qur\'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33.\nEvery verse in the Qur\'an has a corresponding "circumstance of\nrevelation" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the\nverse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance\nin which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say\nthat all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the\nMuslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when\nthey were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life\nsituations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can\nall be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal\nrelationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that\narriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how\neach applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task.\nIt is not necessarily a simple "this or that" process. There may\nbe many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in\nwhich a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters\nimpinge on the situation.\n\nIn other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur\'an.\nThe Qur\'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must\nentail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith.\nIf the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each\nperson has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that.\nHowever, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to\nthe\nState, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society,\nthe dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there \nare certain minimum requirements of understanding that one \nshould achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of \nthese requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:\n\n"...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating\nverse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one,\nand a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between\na permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of\nMeccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances \nof revelation, and does not understand the technical words of\nthe Qur\'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the\nknowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and\ndelaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from\nthe deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning\nfrom the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer,\nthe disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive,\nand is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the\nsubsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the\ndetailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the\nduties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and\ndoes not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those\ncoming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know\nthe Qur\'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur\'an....".\n\nBased on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur\'anic\nverses ("Why should not a company from every group remain behind \nto gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn \npeople when they return to them, so that they may beware." (9:122)),\na science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements\nfor a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on\nmatters of law and religion) are many. I\'ve listed a few major \ndivisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these\nheadings.\n\n- Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory).\n- Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir.\n- Logic (mantiq)\n- A knowledge of Hadiths\n- A knowledge of transmitters (rijal)\n- Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur\'an, Sunnah, Consensus,\nReasoning)\n\nThe study of Qur\'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves:\n- discussion of imperatives (awamir)\n- discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi)\n- discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas)\n- discussion of unconditional and conditional\n- discussion of tacit meanings\n- discussion of the abstract and the clear\n- discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated\n\nThe principles of Application of the law involves:\n- principles of exemption\n- principles of precaution\n- principles of option\n- principles of mastery\n\nThe jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process\nin pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter\nof looking at one verse and one hadith. \n\nNow no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference\nbetween blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is\nclearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the\n"The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as \nlong as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures,\nand wealth of this world." The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: "O Messenger\nof God! How may we know if they so concern themselves?" He (S.A.) replied:\n"By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear for\nyour religion and shun them." I do not yet know enough about the Imams\nof the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies\nto them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.\n\nThe Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as "The fortress of Islam". My only\npoint is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into\nplay a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is \ndelineated in the Qur\'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise\nare praised in both the Qur\'an and hadith - those who without the requisite\nknowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion \nare cautioned.\n\nThe only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this\ngroup, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is,\napostasy), was wrong. When one discusses something they should at least\nbase their discussion on fact. Secondly, Khomeini was condemned as a\nheretic\nbecause he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance of\ncreating a straw man and then beating him.\n\n\nI agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup.\nUnfortunately,\nI do not have any access to email, so private discussion or a moderated\ngroup\nis out of the question (I cannot post to a moderated group like\nsoc.religion.islam.

There wasn't exactly a radical\nshift in policy when he was ousted (something people seem to forget). The\nonly real question is whether they did it as well as Ferreira could have if\nhe stayed, or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since Ferreira has been\nquoated as saying he's going to do something different in Anaheim with the\nDucks, my guess is that it wasn't as good in practice as it was on paper,\nand he's tweaking it a bit second time around).

I thought the Jets defence looked overmatched by the\nCanucks forwards - they will have to improve on that if they want to\nmake this a series.\n\n    In short, it was a great start!\n", "\n\nUnfortunately, that is the way the league is heading... You can't fight,\nso the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when\nthe ref isn't looking. Ulf has brought this to a high level... Players\nstuck in the past (like Neely) who prefer fights to cheap shots\nare at a disadvantage in the new system.\n\nLets face it, A cheap shot (like high sticking) is a very effective\nmethod... It is easier to hide from the refs, has a better chance of\ncausing injury, and you can draw people into fights that way. I don't\nlike it, but that's the way the league is going.", "\nSo what do we have now, an integral over pain X time?\n\nI get to lash you with a wet noodle for ever, but I only get to\ncut you up with a power saw if I'm quick about it?", '\nHeh... Try the rec.autos.sport FAQ. They are always calling ESPN to complain.\nI\'m sure you could find the number for ABC there too, as many west-coast \nviewers were compaining about how something as boring as hockey cut into\nthe Long Beach GP. =)\n\n\nWere you (and several of the other people here it seems) asleep the day\n"contracts" were explained? ASPN has a piece of paper saying it MUST\nshow that baseball game if it happens. Many businesses payedd money to\nhave their commercials run during a baseball game. This is a business,\nnot your own personal video servant.\n\n\nMaybe you should put that anger into something positive. For example, I saw\nads for the new Dodge both on the ESPN and KBL broadcasts. Why not write to\nDodge saying that "thanks to the ads run during the STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS, \nyou will now concider their products in the future. They love to hear stuff\nlike that and in the future will be more willing to buy commercial time\nfor hockey games, giving ESPN (and other networks) more incentive to carry\ngames (just one example)\n\nCome on people, as great as we think it is, Hockey does not leapfrog the\n"big three" overight.', '\n\n\nCute characterization Bill; however, there is no inconsistency between \nthe two statements.  Even if one believes that religion is "primitive, \nsimple-minded and unscientific, anti-intellectual and childish", one\ncan still hold the view that religion also adds an unnecessary level of\ncomplexity to the explanation.  The ideas themselves don\'t have to be\ncomplex before being excised by Occam\'s Razor, they only have to add \nunnecessarily to the overall complexity of the description.\n\n\nI think the non-essential part of an explanatory system is one that\nadds no predictive capability to the system.\n\n\nHuh?\n\n ^^^^^\nWatch it, your Freudian Slip is showing\n', "\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering how often and how badly he has slammed the Pens on Coach's \nCorner on Hockey Night in Canada, it would surprise me as well.  But then,\npeople will do anything for money, won't they?\n\n", '\nI agree that Keenan is an excellent choice.  Did you see Mike\nLupica\'s column in Sunday\'s news?  My sentiments exactly.  I\nthink he just may be the one to instill some hunger and fire\ninto their hearts next season.  Either that or he\'s going to \nbe kicking alot of butt!\n\n\nI\'m here, but am new to this group and have been keeping fairly\nquiet (you know, doing the "lurking" thing).  I don\'t have a\nsense how many Rangers fans there are on the list either.  I \nam a die-hard Ranger fan (I guess I have to be - I sat in the\nGarden throughout the Penguins\' - led by Mario\'s 5 goals - decimation \nof them on 4/9), but am sick at the abundance of talent that has\nbeen totally untapped, and the lack of heart displayed this\nseason.\n\n\nHurlbut was injured for quite a while.  I\'m not sure, but I\nthink he may have recovered in time for the playoff run, and\nif so, like you, question why he wasn\'t used.\n\n\nI believe Kocur was used, in many instances, for his intimidation \nfactor.  Granted, he seemed to get an awful lot of ice time for \nthat reason alone, but you have to realize that when a team is\nnot doing any REAL physical intimidation (I\'d like to have a nickel \nfor every time J.D. said \'They\'ve got to take the body more\'), \nyou\'ve got to at least have some illusions ;-(\n\n\nI agree and I don\'t know.\n\n\nSorry, I don\'t agree with you here.  I think Joey C. did a good\njob filling in when he was asked to.  I can\'t imagine that it\'s\neasy going from near 0 ice time to being a full timer.  I don\'t\nseem to remember him turning the puck over at the blue line too\nmuch, or failing to clear the zone.  He worked hard, and at\nleast didn\'t make any rookie mistakes.  As he said himself in an\ninterview, he can only give what he has.  and he did.  \n\n\nAbsolutely.  I think attendance at the Garden was better on the\nlast day of the season, than any average night for the\nIslanders.\n\n\nThe man is awesome.  In a way, I\'m enjoying the playoffs more,\nnow that the Rangers aren\'t in them.  I can really appreciate\nall the glory Mario is getting without \'hating\' him because he\'s\non the opposing team.  He deserves it all, as far as I\'m\nconcerned.\n\n\t\t- Mary', "\nProve it.  I am an atheist.

I\'m sure the fine young Americans who\ncarpet-bombed Iraqi infantry positions from over the horizon,\ndestroyed Iraq\'s sewer and water infrastructure from the safety of the\nsky or further, or who bulldozed other Iraqi infantry into their\ntrenches [or more importantly the commanders who ordered them to] were\njust thrilled to be risking death (if not risking it by much) in the\ndefense of the liberty of ... well, wealthy Kuwaitis.

While the exact details are not known, it is believed\n- to concern the Oiler's future.\n-\n- Rumour has it that Pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement\n- with Copps Collesium in Hamilton. During the press conference,\n- Pocklington may announce the deal. It is quite possible that\n- the deal may simply be a way to force Edmonton Northlands to\n- renegotiate the Oiler lease on the stadium.\n-\n- Northlands has offered to buy the Oilers for $65 million earlier,\n- but the offer was rejected immediately by Pocklington.\n-\n- As for me, my opinion is divided... Edmonton has been fairly\n- supportive of the Oilers. Even though they're a small market\n- team, they had many sellouts in the 80s. Even with the problems\n- that the team had this year, they still brought in more fans\n- than many teams in larger cities did. On the other hand, if\n- the team does move, there is no place more deserving than\n- Hamilton. Of course, how would that affect the grand\n- realignment scheme of Bettman?\n-\n\n  Following up on this, the provincial government has been asked by the\nOpposition to block any deal that Pocklington is offering to Hamilton.  The\ngovernment said that Pock is going nowhere!\n\n  Why don't I believe the government?  Wasn't it Pocklington who wanted to be\nTory leader 9 years ago?"]
