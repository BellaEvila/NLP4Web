44	There are presently fifty to one hundred technical journals being published.  On the average, two new journals appear every day.  In the many journals published, one to two million articles appear every year.  What attempts have been made to cope with this amount of scientific and technical publication in terms of analysis, control, storage, and retrieval?
45	I am looking for information about the impact of automation on libraries and its significance for libraries in general.  This includes the increasing importance of automation in view of the proliferation of information today, and how automation can help libraries cope with this problem.  How will automation affect libraries and how should they react to the idea of automation?
46	I am seeking information on the use of data processing in libraries and the mechanization of routine library processes and procedures.  I would like descriptions of both general and specific applications of automation in such areas as circulation, cataloging, acquisitions, serial records, and other record-keeping.  Examples should be based on the operation of a conventional public or university library, or practices in a special library which could also be applied in a public or university library.  Give descriptions of equipment and operations, both present and projected.
49	Most resources have been spent on applying information retrieval techniques to the physical and medical sciences.  But, has information retrieval been used at all in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities?  If so, what have been some of the problems which have been encountered with these subject areas and how have they been solved, if at all?  Have the characteristics of these subject areas necessitated the development of new information retrieval techniques? What are the prospcts for future machine control in these areas?
50	Is there any use for traditional classification schemes - DDC, UDC, LC, etc. - in information retrieval systems?  If there is, which scheme appears most suited to machine use and where has it been applied? If there is not, why are these classification schemes irrelevant? Has research shown that a subject classification of knowledge is completely unnecessary in machine systems? Or, have new schemes been devised which appear to be more suited to machine use?
54	What is the effect on librarians of automation?  Note the new types of technology to be used in the library which will have an effect on the status, position, and function of the librarians.  What changes are being contemplated or have been initiated to introduce automation into the education of librarians?
76	This paper discusses the origins of library networks and traces their development in the United States in the late 1960s through the present. The concept of resource sharing, with particular attention to the inter- library loan and programs for the cooperative acquisition and storage of materials, is examined in relationship to library networks.  In particular, attention is given to the question of how these two major components of library cooperation, which have tended to be separate, might become more closely integrated.
90	Many information scientists are concerned with the operation of document retrieval systems serving scientists in various fields.  The scientists served by these systems are often members of what have been called invisible colleges, groups of scientists in frequent communication with one another and involved with highly specialized subject matters.  Often such groups are considered to share an intellectual perspective regarding this subject matter, which is sometimes referred to as a paradigm. The purpose of this paper is to show how it is possible to identify paradigms, using the techniques of citation analysis.  I will operationalize the notion of paradigm as a 'consensual structure of concepts in a field.' Suppose we have obtained a set of papers pertaining to some topic.  Already knowing something about the field, we read each text and mark passages in which certain specific concepts are used or discussed.  For example, we might find that a concept designated 'A' appears in some sub-set of the papers.  Suppose further that we identify those papers in which concepts 'A' and 'B' are used together in the same papers in a certain specified manner. Clearly not all concepts will combine in a natural way, and not all authors combining concepts 'A' and 'B' will do so in the same way, though some predominant mode may emerge.  For a set of n concepts their structure is given by the totality of admissible combinations of concepts taken from two to n at a time.  The frequency with which a given combination occurs in the sample of papers on the topic is a measure of the degree of consensus regarding the particular concept combination within the corpus.  For concepts taken two at a time, the structure can be displayed as a graph with concepts as nodes and the relations between them represented as lines (arcs) connecting the nodes.  This definition of concept structure is similar to the semantic network of artificial intelligence except that in our approach a measure of consensus weights each arc of the graph.
92	The number of databases, records contained in databases and the online use of databases has increased dramatically over the past several years, bringing the 1979 totals for bibliographic, bioliographic-related, and natural language databases to 528.  These 528 databases contain 148 million records.  Some 4 million online searches were conducted via the major U.S. and Canadian systems in 1979.
109	"It is shown that the mapping of a particular area of science, in this case information science, can be done using authors as units of analysis and the cocitations of pairs of authors as the variable that indicates their ""distances"" from each other.  The analysis assumes that the more two authors are cited together, the closer the relationship between them.  The raw data are cocitation counts drawn online from Social Scisearch (Social Sciences Citation Index) over the period 1972-1979.  GThe resulting map shows (1) identifiable author groups (akin to ""schools"") of information science, (2) locations of these groups with respect to each other, (3) the degree of centrality and peripherality of authors within groups, (4) proximities of authors within group and across group boundaries (""border authors"" who seem to connect various areas of research), and (5) positions of authors with respect to the map's axes, which were arbitrarily set spanning the most divergent groups in order to aid interpretation.  Cocitation analysis of authors offers a new technique that might contribute to the understanding of intellectual structure in the sciences and possibly in other areas to the extent that those areas rely on serial publications.  The technique establishes authors, as well as documents, as an effective unit in analyzing subject specialties."
