58	Relevance Disagreements and Unclear Request Forms	"Disagreements about the relevance of documents to retrieval requests occur because relevance judges differently interpret requests of documents.. Requests may be differently interpreted because they are unclear.. Well-known types of request obscurity are reviewed.. Less well known is that a request may be unclear because its form - ""documents about subject S"", ""document answering question Q"", etc. - is unclear.. Explications are developed of the meanings of the request forms just given and several others.. A request of any of the forms discussed is interpreted to be for documents which support statements of a specified kind in a specified way.. Examples are given which suggest that some, perhaps all, ""about S"" requests are unclear.. Some ways of formulating clear question requests are given.. Various ways in which documents may support statements are distinguished.. These depend on on such factors as parts of a document use, inference strength, and background knowledge permitted.. Some possible clear support specifications are indicated.."
887	COM Catalog Based on OCLC Records	The production of a COM catalog using OCLC records on magnetic tape is outlined.. Standards developed within the library community as represented in the MARK format have made this catalog possible.. A brief overview of the procedures involved and of the catalog is presented..
235	Book Catalogs	In the intervening years since the appearance of the first collection of papers concerning book catalogs (Kingery, Robert E., and Tauber, Maurice F., Book Catalogs, N.Y., The Scarecrow Press, 1963), attention has been concentrated on the book catalog as a substitute for, or an auxiliary to the card catalog. This selection of papers has identified some of the efforts to solve particular problems concerned with book catalogs.  The published papers, as well as those which have been written specifically for this volume, bring additional observations concerning the place of the book catalog in library services.
1435	International Standardization of Cataloguing and Bibliographical Records: The Work of the IFLA Committee on Cataloguing	The ILFA Committee on Cataloguing has been at work since 1954 to establish international standards for cataloguing and bibliographical records, and was responsible for the International conference on Cataloguing Principles, Paris, 1961, and the International Medical of Cataloguing Experts, Copenhagen, 1969.  A new impetus to its work has been given in 1971 with the establishment of its permanent Cataoguing Secretariat whose function were to act as a co-ordinating centre, to promote cataloguing projects and to disseminate information.
675	Atom-by-Atom Typewriter Input for Computerized Storage and Retrieval of Chemical Structures	"Novel features have been added to a paper tape typewriter having a removable typing element.  A symbol set has been devised which requires only nine characters for typing common chemical structures.  The typewriter has an uncoded ""INDEX"" key which advances the paper without carriage return.  A companion key, ""BACK INDEX,"" was provided which directly retracts the paper.  Both have been coded.  A tape record containing information sufficient for a computer to calculate an atom-bond connection table for a chemical structure is obtained by typing the structure in any order solely from the keyboard or by use of the reader with prepunched tapes containing frequently occurring substructures. Cost was about one-fourth that of earlier paper tape chemical typewriters."
1114	Analysis of Information Flows in Shipbuilding and the Allied Fields	Parameters of information flows are identified as reflected in VINITI's abstract journals carrying materials in shipbuilding and the related fields.. The objective of the large-scale analysis of these flows is to support the development of an automated system of ship design and the industry's sci-tech information subsystem..  More than 1400 periodicals and serials have been identified that are relevant to the field..  The file of secondary publications in the field carried by VINITI abstract journals since 1956 amounted to 185,000 items..
1128	Free Information of a Social System	"The structure of the information field of a social system is examined, analyzing the processes of formation of scientific concepts.. The functional structure of the information field is shown to reflect that of human brain.. It is established that the effect of the ""wash-off"" of noise out of the information field with the course of time leads to concentration of the real, socially valid free information in publications covering finite time spans.. The interrelations within the service/user system are shown to be essentially different for scientific vs industrial information supplies.."
972	Graph Model for Library Information Networks	The design and study of library information networks are enhanced by the use of the concepts which have been developed by graph theorists.. In this paper we expand upon this theme, proposing a general network structure which we believe to be a good model for a wide variety of library and other information networks.. The basic concepts from graph theory are illustrated with the aid of a hypothetical Public Library Access Network (PLAN)..
283	Academic Status for College and University Librarians -  Problems and Prospects	Academic librarians will archive and deserve full academic status only after they cause changes in the bureaucratic structure of libraries and in library education, and when they provide professional service on a scholarly level..
854	Library Network Analysis and Planning (Lib-Nat)	A preliminary report on planning for network design undertaken by the Reference Round Table of the Texas Library Association and the State Advisory Council to Library services and Construction Act Title III Texas Program.. Necessary components of a network are discussed, and network transactions of eighteen Dallas area libraries analyzed using a methodology and quantitative measures developed for this project..
1380	Statistical Bibliography in Relation to the Growth of Modern Civilization	The following pages form the concluding portion of four lectures delivered by me in the University of Cambridge as Sandars Reader in Bibliography, 1921. As the two pairs of lectures appeal to widely different classes of the community, I have decided to print them separately, though the underlying theme is the same, viz. the need for uniformity in book classification as a preliminary to co-operative action in library administration and bibliography. Book classification is shelf classification, and shelf classification carried to its furthest limits leads necessarily to uniformity in the extension and definition of its classes.  Add to this a chronological order of books in their classes and your scheme of classification acquires a new value; for it presents for each period a bibliographical counterpart of the corresponding growth of the activities of the human mind. My first two lectures dealt with this thesis in its practical application to library work and the compilation of subject bibliographies.  Here statistical bibliography is considered in relation to the growth of modern civilization. Strictly speaking, the province of statistical bibliography ends with the presentation of the figures compiled.  Their final interpretation should be left to those possessing the necessary qualifications.  I am, therefore, conscious that in attempting to furnish some explanation of the interrelations of the various factors which are associated with the growth of modern civilization, I have outstripped the limits of bibliographical propriety.  On this count I offer no defense.
357	Directory of Data Base in the Social and Behavioral Sciences	As one of the early members of the computer community, I have been keenly interested in the development of quantitative methodologies in the social and behavioral sciences, and their encouragement by the data processing environment.  The economists, with an already established mathematical orientation, were among the earliest beneficiaries of the machine technology that enhances their ability to construct the test models of economic behavior.  Today, statistical methods have so affected many disciplines that it is not unusual for doctoral programs to accept statistical techniques as a substitute for one foreign language.  Similarly, the ability to program in an appropriate language is also frequently as acceptable as French or German in providing the research skills needed by doctoral students at The City University of New York and at other universities. The chief function of this directory, in terms of academic supplies of data, is not to reinventory the social science data archives that are well-known to the academic community, not to duplicate the announcements of holdings that they themselves make available to their members.  The reason for mentioning them and indicating the nature of their holdings is to make this kind of data resource known to those researchers, either in or out of the university, who are not sufficiently aware of these important resources.
1428	Understanding Scientific Literatures: A Bibliographic Approach	As the author states, the methods he describes treat the growth of a scientific literature as a social phenomenon in its own right, not as a material byproduct of the knowledge and concepts of the science written about.  Management of the literature of physics, say, does not first demand the study of physics, but of physicists.  Management of the literature of information sciences demands first the study of information scientists.
473	Bibliographic Coupling  Extended in Time: Ten Case Histories	The methods of bibliographic coupling were applied to 8186 papers in thirty- five volumes of the Physical Review (Vol. 77, 1950 to Vol. 111, 1958).. The results are reported in the form of ten case histories.. Each case was chosen to illustrate a problem in information retrieval..
1278	Mathematical Evaluation of the Scientific Serial	In this article is offered an improved citation-count method, designed to measure qualitatively the value of any scientific serial by means of a related quantitative citation count.
1292	Computer-Assisted Design of Complex Organic Synthesis	This article is concerned with the general theory of chemical synthesis and with the application of machine computation to the generation of chemical pathways for the synthesis of complicated organic molecules.  The basis for the approach which has been developed comes in large measure from the methods used by chemists in the solution of certain types of synthetic problems.
1085	Bradford's Law and the Bibliography of Science	The rationalization of scientific library systems might be greatly facilitated by the application of Bradford's law, formulated more than twenty years ago.
531	Index Term Weighting	Various approaches to index term weighting have been investigated.. In particular, claims have been made for the value of statistically-based indexing in automatic retrieval systems.. The paper discusses the logic of different types of weighting, and describes experiments testing weighting schemes of these types.. The result show that one type of weighting leads to material performance improvements in quite different collection environments..
788	The Use of Social Science Periodical Literature	The paper presents the results of a survey of the use of social science periodicals carried out at the National Lending Library during a period of four weeks in 1968.. Three-quarters of the requests came from universities and industrial organizations and over 90% of the requests were for English language publications.. Over a fifth of the requests were for seventeen titles.. There were marked variations in the subject matter requested by different types of organizations and although the overall 'half-life' of the literature proved to be 3 1/2 years this figure varied considerably from one subject to another.. Concerning the sources of references, it was discovered that compared with scientists and technologists social scientists make relatively little use of abstracting and indexing publications.. Appendixes include a copy of the questionnaire used in the survey, a list of title requested six or more times, and a list of abstracting and indexing publications cited five or more times as sources of references..
161	User Studies:  A Review of the Literature from 1966 to 1970	My terms of reference when asked to prepare this review of user studies were to bring Fishenden's work up to date.  This was published in the Journal of Documentation in September 1965 and in his paper he looks at a limited number of British use studies and draws some broad general conclusions relating to the development of a national information service.  The present paper which covers the literature back to the beginning of 1966 is somewhat more detailed.  It considers a wide range of investigations into the information gathering habits of scientists, engineers, social scientists and others, and reports results which it is hoped will provide managers with information on which to develop policies regarding library and information services at all levels.  Although an increasing number of studies is being carried out in Eastern Europe and in the USSR there has been no major work reported and consequently the review considers mainly British and American investigations.
952	Characteristics of the Research Literature Used by Chemists and Physicists in the United States	The increasing growth and complexities of research libraries are natural consequences of the growth of knowledge and the increasing complexity of knowledge. Librarians have tried to amass more and more knowledge in the form of books for the benefit of the diverse interests of their clienteles.  Their success in this activity has been reflected in the increasing difficulties of identifying satisfactorily what they have.  The processes of cataloging, classifying, and related technical routines have become increasingly complex and expensive.  The processes are of such a nature that the cost for adding each new item to a large library is, on the average, potentially if not actually, higher than that for its predecessor.  The total proportion of the budgets of large research libraries that is spent for the processing of material, as distinguished from the costs of its purchase or its direct servicing, is now such as to give librarians pause for fear a day may come when nearly all the money available to large libraries will be spent in processing material, and little will be left to service the collection or to buy new books!
521	Compression of Bibliographic Files Using an Adaptation of Run-Length Coding	Substantial degrees of compression of bibliographical data bases result from the application to them a modified form of run-length coding.. The method involves attenuation of the zero:one bit ratio of the data base.. This can be achieved by substitution of codes with the highest zero:one ratios the most frequent symbols, or by substitution of 2-bytes codes for diagrams.. A form of run-length coding in which the run-length is represented as a fixed-length binary number is then applied..
448	An Evaluation of Query Expansion by the Addition of Clustered Terms for a Document Retrieval System	An evaluation of graph theoretical clusters of index terms which can be extracted from an automatically indexed document collection, and the effects of employing such cluster in automatic document retrieval is described.. The graph theoretical cluster which were developed from six data base under two different cluster definition were analyzed for average size and related data.. The clusters were also used to expand the queries in each of six data bases to determine the effect of the expansions on the document retrieval results.. Although a large variety of clusters and associated query explanations were obtained, no significant improvements in the document retrieval performance were achieved.. In some cases, however, significant degradations in the retrieval performance occurred.. Although seemingly meaningful clusters can be obtained, the results indicate that the effort involved in finding clusters and adding the clustered terms to queries is far to great to warrant their use in an operational system.. The data bases employed were relatively small, and the  authors caution against generalizing these results to large data bases or other  situations..
1445	User Requirements in Identifying Desired Works in Large Libraries	The work reported here is a study of the utilization of the card catalog of a very large library, specifically the principal catalog of the library system of Yale University. The study was motivated by two basic concerns, one of them of a long-term, or exploratory, nature, the other of a short-term, or operationally supportive, nature.  The long-term concern is the question of how to design a computerized catalog for a very large library that can be expected to give the best possible performance.  The short-term concern is the question of whether, and, of so, how, existing card catalogs in very large libraries may be made more responsive to user requirements.  It was recognized that a carefully designed study of actual utilization of a catalog of a large library could shed useful light in both areas of concern.
234	Book Availability and the Library User	The essentially logistical problem of making library books physically available when wanted by library users is central to librarianship.  This book is a tentative attempt to provide a treatise on this problem.  As such it has to deal with both theoretical analysis and the practicality of solutions.  No apology is made for the attention devoted to theoretical analysis, because the author believes that a clear conceptual understanding of the factors involved is important for improved librarianship.  The fact that analytical models are not always usable does not mean that the insight that can sometimes be derived from such analyses will not lead to a better understanding of the problems and, thereby, to improved library services.
1075	Possibilities for Revisions of the DK (Decimal Classification)	For a number of reasons mentioned it is proposed to reorganize in a new edition the existing UDC completely, to reallocate the subject fields of the UDC main classes according to present day views, state of knowledge and priorities, and to subdivide these main classes only by subfields of subject fields.  The specific facets of each field should be represented by a uniform array of special auxiliaries attached to the fields through the technique of interrupted subdivision.  These should express the following categories: (1) Theory, (2) Objects, (3) Processes, (4) Attributes, (6) Order, organization, (7) Relation, (8) Determination, (9) Evaluation. ((5) is left free for the moment).  Proposals for further simplification of the scheme are outlined regarding the general categories, the symbols used and the rules for syntagmatic organization taking into account the implications of computer technology.  Possible changes in the layout and editions of a new UDC are discussed.
644	A Decision Theoretic Foundation for Indexing	The indexing of a document is among the most crucial steps in preparing that document for retrieval.. The adequacy of the indexing determines the ability of the system to respond to patron requests.. This paper discusses this process, and document retrieval in general, on the basis of formal decision theory.. The basic theoretical approach taken is illustrated by means of a model of word occurrences in documents in the context of a model information system; both models are fully defined in this paper.. Though the main purpose of this paper is to provide insights into a very complex process, formulae are developed that may prove to be of value for an automated operating system..The paper concludes with an interpretation of recall and precision curves as seen from the point of view of decision theory..
1366	The Computerized File Management System	A file management system can provide a powerful search tool for a library reference group.  The system described produces both current awareness and retrospective searches from several diverse data bases.  The same query language can be used to interrogate all data bases in either on-line or batch mode. Searches can be made for any word, word root, phrase, or number in any part of any entry.  Citations selected by coordination of terms can be either printed or used to custom-make new machine-readable files.  Costs are reasonable; an average batch mode search requires 11 seconds of CDC 6600 time.
1206	Personnel Utilization in Libraries A Systems Approach	In the late 1960s nearly all professions in the United States thought they faced severe shortages of manpower in their fields, both in professional and supporting areas.  Librarianship was not immune: there was more work to be done than existing staffs could do; there were budgeted professional vacancies that could not be filled.  And, concurrently, there were concerns being quietly expressed that some of the shortages could be ameliorated by a changed utilization of existing manpower. It was at this time and out of these concerns that Julius R. Chitwood, then president of the Illinois Library Association, appointed an ad hoc Committee on Manpower Training and Utilization to study patterns of staff assignments and to recommend to library administrators more effective ways of utilizing professional staff.  After examining the use of professional staff in a few libraries, however, it became clear to this committee of volunteer researchers that they could not do the job which needed doing.  It was also clear that a need was there, that a small segment of the library manpower problem could be more fully explored, that the results of a serious study in Illinois might have national implications, and that the resources for such a study should be sought.
173	Authoritarian Personality	"This is a book about social discrimination.  But its purpose is not simply to add a few more empirical findings to an already extensive body of information.  The central theme of the work is a relatively new concept - the rise of an ""anthropological"" species we call the authoritarian type of man.  In contrast to the bigot of the older style he seems to combine the ideas and skills which are typical of a highly industrialized society with irrational or anti-rational beliefs.  He is at the same time enlightened and superstitious, proud to be an individualist and in constant fear of not being like all the others, jealous of his independence and inclined to submit blindly to power and authority.  The character structure which comprises these conflicting trends has already attracted the attention of modern philosophers and political thinkers.  This book approaches the problem with the means of socio-psychological research."
537	The Information Sciences	This book describes the results of a study which the author has carried out during the summer of 1969 in Heidelberg and San Francisco about the development of the information sciences in the Federal Republic of Germany. This study was conducted following an undertaking between the Federal Ministry for Scientific Research, the Institute for Documentation questions, and the Study Group for Research in System Science.
1160	Methodological problems of scientific-technical literature typology	Two causes for inconsistency between a primary document is content and form are examined. 1) Inconsistency between document structure and structure of its information. 2) Insufficient development of theories of scientific, and technical literature, in particular, the typology of primary scientific documents. It is suggested that the concept of genres of scientific-technical literature be introduced, based on the degree to which the material is generalized. Five basic genres are examined:  technical reports, articles, monographs, text- books and reference works. The practical application of a typology of scientific and technological literature is shown to be possible.
261	Classification Scheme for Law Books	An examination made over a period of years of the principles of classifying law books for use in libraries, and of their treatment in many general and specialized classification schemes convinced me that no scheme existed which was generally suitable for libraries in English- speaking countries outside the United States.  Law collections in academic libraries in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth were in a particularly difficult position.  They had the choice of adopting one of the good American schemes, which generally make inadequate provision for the needs of overseas Commonwealth libraries; or of adopting one of the English schemes, each of which is virtually tailored to a particular library, and several of which are even less well suited to overseas libraries; or of devising new schemes for themselves.  There seemed to be an urgent need for a practical law classification scheme capable of being used in a variety of libraries, large and small, general and special, academic and professional, in these countries.
1195	Comparative Effects of Titles, Abstracts and Full Texts on Relevance Judgements	Twenty-two users submitted 99 questions to experimental IR systems and received 1086 documents as answers, receiving first titles, then abstracts, and finally full texts.. Ability of users to recognize relevance from shorter formats in comparison to full text judgement was observed.. Of 1086 answers evaluated, 843 or 78% had the same judgement on all three formats.. Of 207 answers judged relevant from full text, 131 were judged so from titles and 160 from abstracts.. Parallels between users' and IR systems' performance on shorter formats are drawn..
625	On Selecting a Measure of Retrieval Effectiveness	It is argued that a user's subjective evaluation of the personal utility of a retrieval system's output to him, if it could be properly quantified, would be a near-ideal measure of retrieval effectiveness.. A hypothetical methodology is presented for measuring this utility by means of an elicitation procedure.. Because the hypothetical methodology is impractical, compromise methods are outlined and their underlying simplifying assumptions are discussed.. The more plausible the simplifying assumptions on which a performance measure is based, the better the measure.. This, along with evidence gleaned from 'validation experiments' of a certain kind, is suggested as a criterion for selecting or deriving the best measure of effectiveness to use under given test conditions..
580	Overlap in the Lists of Journals Monitored by Biosis, CAS, and Ei	In April 1970, the BioSciences Information Service of Biological Abstracts, the Chemical Abstracts Service, and Engineering Index, Inc. began a five-part study to determine the relationships between and the overlap in coverage in their printed publications and computer-readable services.. This study was designed to provide information needed by these three accessing services for planning future cooperative programs and for reconciling differences in policies and practices so as to make their publications and services more useful to their user communities.. This paper is based on the first part of the study, which compared listings of the journals each service was routinely monitoring as of 1 May 1970.. Of the 14,592 different journals monitored, 1% were monitored by all three of the services, 27% were monitored by two of the three services, and 72% were monitored by only one of the three services.. Subsequent phases of the study will determine the extent to which the services cover the same articles within the journals..
997	The Ohio College Library Center	The Ohio College Library Center is a regional library network.. Its on-line shared cataloging system has been operational since 18 October 1971,and utilizes cathode ray tube terminals located in the center's fifty-three member libraries.. These terminals are connected to the Sigma 5 computer in Columbus by a multiple line, multiple party synchronous transmission telephone network.. Between January and June 1972 the system operated at an annual rate of 500,000 works cataloged and over 3,400,000 catalog cards produced .. These cards are individualized to fit the requirements of each member and are produced in packs designated for particular catalogs..
833	A New Linear Notation System Based on Combinations of Carbon and Hydrogen	A new linear notation system is described which was designed to have a one-to-one correspondence with the chemical structures represented by the notations.. Each notation is unique and unambiguous, yet simple and compatible with computer input and output characters.. The symbols used in the notation system denote carbon in terms of bounds and attached hydrogen(s).. The notation system is illustrated with acyclic, carbocyclic, and heterocyclic examples..
767	Journal Usage Versus Age of Journal	The effective planning of technical libraries would be greatly facilitated if there were some theoretical basis which could be used to predict the probable distribution by titles, and by age of journal, of future journal demand.  As a first step, the author has recently developed a general expression for the distribution among journal titles of large groups of journal references. In this present paper a relationship between usage and age of journal is established and the application of this relationship to some library planning problems is illustrated.
43	The Consistency of Human Judgments of Relevance	A comparison of the ability of humans to consistently judge the relevance of documents to their general interests from bases of citations, abstracts, keywords, and total text was made under controlled experimental conditions.. The results showed that 1) humans are able to make such judgments consistently, and 2) the consistency of the judgment is independent of the particular base from which it is made.. Apparent inconsistency arising from judgments made on the basis of abstracts remains unexplained.. This experiment, as well as others concerned with human evaluations of text material, leave unexplored the basic problem of providing a metric scale on which such evaluations can be measured..
225	A Method of Estimating the In-House Use of the Periodical Collection in the University of Minnesota Bio-Medical Library	During two one-week periods in April 1972, information on periodical title and date was gathered from  periodicals collected from study and reshelving tables of the University of Minnesota Bio-Medical Library. It was determined that: (1) a few titles accounted for most of the total use; (2) the relationship between age and amount of use of a journal may be described by the equation y = ke**(-bx); and (3) the last five years of publication accounted for 58% of the total use.
483	Performance of Automatic Information Systems	The SMART document retrieval system is used to investigate algorithms for text analysis and request searching.. Results from three document collections indicate that word normalization is efficiently performed by automatic thesaurus lookup, while phrase matching procedures, statistical association methods, and concept hierarchies are useful for special applications.. Automatic document clustering schemes and use-interactive feedback methods permit rapid searches of large collections.. Abstracts are found to be superior to titles as a base for content analysis in a document retrieval system and almost as good as complete texts.. Proper procedures for designing dictionaries and searching requests are discussed..The practicality of large scale document centers and their proper design are considered in light of these results..
570	Deriving Term Relations for a Corpus by Graph Theoretical Clusters	"We discuss how alternative methods of automatic term clustering may provide insight into how terms are related within a corpus.  The work reported uses a corpus of 2267 documents that contain 3950 index terms.	A similarity matrix is developed using the document - term matrix.  A threshold level T is applied to the similarity matrix.  Entries in the matrix that are greater than or equal to the threshold level are set equal to one, and the remaining entries are set to zero. Three definitions are applied to the corresponding graph of each threshold matrix to develop clusters. These are, (1) the connected components of the graph, (2) the maximal complete subgraphs of the graph, and (3) the combined maximal complete subgraphs of the graph as described that show how insight may be gained into the term relations by varying the threshold levels and the cluster definitions."
1358	System Design, Evaluation, and Costing	"The word ""system"" as applied to information programs and activities is one which is very foggily defined.  The purpose of this paper is to help clarify the concept and discuss it in the context of the librarian's conventional planning and administrative activities.  This is done through a narration of the step-by-step procedures followed in the conceptualization and design of an actual library and information program.  The steps involved are the following:  definition of the purpose of the program, and financial and administrative constraints on its design and operation, as envisaged by management; a user study to determine needs and preferences of the presumed audience of the program; analysis and definition of program performance requirements; selection of methods and mechanisms for implementing performance requirements; conceptualization and documentation of program design; evaluation of design; modification and completion of design. Two basic principles that are discussed and emphasized are the need to define what the program should be doing and what it should not be doing, and the need and means for determining real as opposed to apparent costs in the design process."
1078	Computerized Information Retrieval Services (Automatisierte Information Retrieval Dienste)	Following an outline of the current trend in information storage, retrieval, and dissemination, this paper provides a description of some of the information services offered at the University of Calgary.  The services include processing of data-bases supplied on magnetic tapes.  The system is briefly characterized as featuring natural text processing.  Selective dissemination of information is directed to users periodically in response to their profiles, and retrospective searches are performed on request, both in the batch mode. Feedback from users and system performance are also briefly reviewed.
293	Change in Academic Libraries	Never noted for their willingness to accept innovative suggestions and implement change from outside sources, academic libraries have remained institutions in which changes in service policies and programs originated from internal sources only.. In order to shift to an orientation that seeks to develop new and expanding service programs, the establishment to research groups could do much to improve both the services offered by a library and its role in the academic community.. While certain constraints always limit modification or the initiation of services, a properly constituted research group could do much to generate a climate for change, provide feedback to the library, and successfully continue to develop new and more effective library and information services..
1453	Women in Librarianship	There are some who question whether the status of women in the library profession is a major issue.  A survey of library literature, however shows an increase in the factual data available regarding differences between men and women in salaries, promotional patterns and other professional situations. There are local library groups which are examining the status of women in their own libraries and organizing to improve their employment situations.  On the state and national level, conference programs and workshops at library association meetings have dealt with various aspects of sex discrimination, affirmative action policies, sexism in children's materials and the like.
879	Providing Bibliograhic Services From Machine-Radable Data Bases - The Library's Role	Libraries will play a key role in providing access to data bases, but not by subscribing to tape services and establishing local processing centers as is commonly assumed.. High costs and the nature of the demand will make this approach unfeasible.. It is more likely that the library's reference staff will develop the capability of serving as a broker between the local campus user and the various regional or specialized retail distribution centers which exist or will be established..
611	What Information Dissemination Studies Imply Concerning the Design of On-Line Reference Retrieval Systems*	"The use of an on-line computer system for locating bibliographic citations has been hailed as an important innovation for coping with the ""information explosion.."" However, on-line reference retrieval is only one element in a large social system of information dissemination.. To have a widespread impact, an on-line system must compete successfully with a multitude of other sources of references.. This paper reviews studies of information dissemination as a basis for determining how on-line retrieval can best compete.  It recommends the functional groups for whom an on-line system should be designed and the forms of written media that should be included in the system's initial data base.. Finally, it presents criteria the system should satisfy to be as widely used and as comprehensive as other reference retrieval methods.."
1454	Work and Motivation	"The basic plan for this book was evolved during the summer of 1959. At that time I was working on a chapter entitled ""Industrial Social Psychology"" for the annual Review of Psychology.  I was impressed by the large amount of research being conducted in the field, but found the task of integrating that research and of identifying the progress made during the period of the review exceedingly difficult.  In part, this difficulty was a result of the great differences among investigators in the phenomena they selected for study and the methods they used to study it.  A more troublesome problem, however, was the apparent theoretical implications of their research.  Concepts tended to be highly specific and inadequately defined.  There was little standardization of terminology and little consideration for the nature of the processes underlying empirical data."
1106	Efficiency of Information Service at a Research Institute (findings of a questionnaire survey)	Discussing the problem of evaluation of the efficiency of an information service at a research institute, the paper presents the results of a questionnaire survey conducted in 1968 at an electronics industry research establishment; the objective of the survey was to work out improvements of the special information system..
262	Classification and Subject Index for a Library	The plan of the following Classification and Index was developed early in 1873.  It was the result of several months' study of library economy as found in some hundreds of books and pamphlets, and in over fifty personal visits to various American libraries.  In this study, the author became convinced that the usefulness of these libraries might be greatly increased without additional expenditure.  Three years practical use of the system here explained, leads him to believe that it will accomplish this result; for with its aid, the catalogues, shelf lists, indexes, and cross-references essential to this increased usefulness, can be made more economically than by any other method which he has been able to find.  The system was devised for cataloguing and indexing purposes, but it was found on trial to be equally valuable for numbering and arranging books and pamphlets on the shelves.
1066	A Modern Outline of Library Classification	This outline is based mainly on lectures given at the North-Western Polytechnic to students studying for the Library Association's Registration Examination in Classification and Cataloguing. It is hoped that it will help to meet the need, increasingly felt in recent years by students and teachers of the subject, for a reasonably simple textbook on Library Classification which takes account of the considerable developments which have occurred in the subject in the past 25 years.  As is well known, a great deal of this has been due to Dr. Ranganathan, and also, in more recent years, to Mr. B. C. Vickery.  As a result of these developments, a coherent theory of library classification has been established in each of its three major departments - in subject analysis, in notation, and in the alphabetical indexing of systematic orders.  It is now possible to construct library classifications whose efficiency in the two basic functions (of relating subjects helpfully, and of locating them rapidly ad unerringly) is considerably greater than the schemes we have so far used.  Moreover, they are easier to construct.
697	Computer Generation of Wiswesser Line Notation. II. Polyfused, Perifused, and Chained Ring Structure	The computer program for the generation of Weswesser Line Notation (WLN) has been extended to include polyfused rings, methyl contraction rules, chain of two ring systems, some perifused rings, some chelates, and some metallocences.. Salts and ions are also handled, but in a different manner than what is normally found.. Multipliers are not used by the program.. The normal input for the WLN generation is an easy input program using a Rand Tablet; however, teletype and connection table input can also be used in most cases..
977	A Study of the Usage and Retention of Technical Periodicals	"Limited physical space expansion, an administrative consideration in every library, becomes a stringent factor in the planning of special libraries.  While public and college libraries may have several decades of growth possibility when they take possession of a building or area, it is indeed a fortunate industrial library whose stacks are not overcrowded after five years of establishment in new quarters.  Industrial floorspace is too greatly in demand to devote more effort to the possible future growth of the library.	Weeding or storage requirements, therefore, are far more immediate considerations to the special industrial library administrators than they are to administrators of other types of libraries.  The limits of expansion are usually apparent earliest in the serials collections of industrial libraries because so much current technical data is published first in scientific and technical periodicals. These collections grow rapidly.  This summarization of a recent study made by one technical library in the area of space for use of technical journals has potential for other libraries."
444	On Relevance as a Measure	Relevance is defined as a measure of information conveyed by a document relative to a query.. It is shown that the relationship between the document and the query, though necessary, is not sufficient to determine relevance..
33	"The ""Half-Life"" of Some Scientific and Technical Literatures"	A consideration of the analogy between the half-life of radioactive substances and the rate of obsolescence of scientific literature.. The validity of this analogy suggest the possibility of more accurate prognostications concerning the period of time during which scientific literature may by used and hence might help to guide the planning of library collections and technical information services..
75	MEDLARS: Report on the Evaluation of Its Operating Efficiency	A comprehensive program to evaluate the performance of MEDLARS was conducted by the National Library of Medicine in 1966 and 1967.. This report describes the methodology used and presents a summary of the principal results, conclusions, and recommendations..
432	Illustrative Computer Programming for Libraries	Illustrative Computer Programming is intended as a graded workbook or text supplement containing typical practical problems, suggested solutions, and tried analyses which emphasize programming efficiency and some of the major features of PL/I (Programming Language/One).  As such, it can be used alone or in combination with established PL/I textbooks such as those listed in the Selected Bibliography.  Programmers with knowledge of other languages will not be bothered by excessive introductory material, while beginners can learn much by looking at the solutions to the problems and their accompanying analyses.
1187	Organizations	"This book is about the theory of formal organizations.  It is easier, and probably more useful, to give examples of formal organizations than to define the term.  The United States Steel Corporation is a formal organization; so is the Red Cross, the corner grocery store, the New York State Highway Department.  The latter organization is, of course, part of a larger one - the New York State government.  But for present purposes we need not trouble ourselves about the precise boundaries to be drawn around an organization or the exact distinction between an ""organization"" and a ""nonorganization.""  We are dealing with empirical phenomena, and the world has an uncomfortable way of not permitting itself to be fitted into clean classifications. Authors are often convinced that the particular subjects with which they are dealing are more significant than the world has acknowledged. We cheerfully make this claim for organization theory.  However much organizations occupy the thoughts of practicing executives and administrators, and however many books for these practitioners have been written about them, the theory of organizations occupies an insignificant place in modern social science.  Most current psychology and sociology textbooks do not devote even a short chapter to the subject of formal organizations.  The Handbook of Social Psychology (Lindzey, 1954) contains chapters on small groups, mass media, ""industrial social psychology"" (with only passing references to organizations), leadership, and voting behavior.  There is no comparable chapter on formal organizations, and only scattered reference to them throughout the text."
784	Documentation Notes	I would suggest three possible reasons for the constant average number of references per article.  Firstly, on average, articles more than fifteen years old rarely get cited as they are rendered obsolete by the rate of advance.  The net increase per annum of 'citeable articles' is not as large as might otherwise be expected. Secondly many relatively small specialized subject areas, each tending to have its own literature and 'internal' citation practices, are hiving off from the classical areas, because of the specialized nature of modern science. Thirdly it seems that the 'building blocks' of an article can on average be adequately specified (regardless of the volume of published information) by reference to about eleven items of the prior art relating to the main theme, associated concepts and methods, and general background.
1274	The Structure of Scientific Literatures II: Toward a Macro- and Microstructure for Science	Part I of this paper described the first steps in mapping the scientific literature, using a new technique - co-citation - to measure the degree of similarity among documents.  The work developed directly from an earlier paper which defined this measure, and explored its relationship to other citation measures for identifying relationships among documents.  We now report the outcome of an attempt to create 'maps' of the scientific literature. The scales of these maps have been systematically manipulated so that they present, not only an overview of all highly-cited papers in natural science, but also a detailed view of a single scientific specialty.  At each level we have systematically sought indications of the validity of the mapping operation, and have indications that the maps display at least certain important aspects of the specialty structure of science.
1235	Public Knowledge An Essay Concerning the Social Dimension of Science	Natural Science, whose internal development for three centuries is so uniform, well-documented and relatively self- generating, is an obvious candidate for such treatment.  And having noticed the intellectual connections between the ideas of various scholars, we must surely pass on to an investigation of the social relations through which those connections are established.  How do scientists teach, communicate with, promote, criticize, honour, give ear to, give patronage to, one another? What is the nature of the community to which they adhere?
549	The Intergroup Conflict	In one broad category of theories, the problems are expressed in terms of actualities of events in group relations as they exist in everyday life.  On the whole, theories advanced by many social scientists fall in this broad category.  In this concern over actualities the problem is frequently not stated and discussion not developed in a way that can be tested rigorously. In the second broad category of theories, problems are stated and analysis carried out in terms of more rigorous-appearing concepts and units of analysis.  Theories coming from psychologists and social scientists heavily influenced by them fall within this broad category.  In this line of approach, theories are advanced without due regard to actualities, and consequently they are plagued with serious questions of validity.
841	Work Study in Libraries	A brief review of the principal work study techniques is given.. It is suggested that these techniques are applicable to libraries and librarians and will become increasingly useful as the problems of increased work loads become more severe.. Data concerning standard times and performances would be useful for system design and planning, providing such data is put in its proper context and particularly if it is used to improve effectiveness as well as efficiency..
1053	Methods of Information Handling	This book is meant to be an aid and reference work for those people who are interested in the design of information systems.  Such information systems are typified by the traditional libraries, but the same problems of information processing, storage, and retrieval are present in many government and industrial organizations in many places besides the library.  This book provides an illustration of the tools, equipment, and methodology that might be applied to those problems.
1124	Some Aspects of Developing and Studying a Descriptor Information Language for General Technology	The methods and results of an endeavor to develop an information retrieval language for automatic retrieval systems meant for handling a polytechnical document collection are described.. The descriptor dictionary includes general and special terms, both single-word and phrase terms, which is conducive to higher recall and relevance; it comprises a classified index and a lexico-semantic index as well as tables of generic relations.. The size of the dictionary is 5,542 descriptors and 3,073 keywords.. The indexing procedure includes:  analysis of document content and its characterization by keywords elicited from natural text; and creation of the search pattern using the descriptor dictionary.. The techniques are described which are applied to analyze the documents into semantic aspects that constitute the elements of the formalized model of a document's condensed content.. The procedure employed to translate a text into the retrieval language comprises selection of words both from the title and the body of the document.. Main principles for retrieval efficiency determination using mathematical-statistic methods are given.. Tests on multi-subject collections show a probability of 85-% recall and 70-% relevance at a standard deviation of 25%.. These findings have been corroborated by the results of the basic experiment on a file of up to 2,500 search patterns using 42 requests..  Among the factors of losses there are the poor quality of abstracts (into cards) and the absence of a single abstracting procedure; it is proposed that abstractors should be in future charged with writing abstracts in keywords and, ultimately, in the descriptor language.. The experimental results attest to the feasibility and practical sensibility of creating a multi-disciplinary information retrieval system to be based on a broad-scope descriptor dictionary and on the suggested methods for document and request indexing..
1091	Effectiveness of Combining Title Words and Index Terms in Machine Retrieval Searches	"Our experiment was based on volume 24 of Nuclear Science Abstracts (NSA) which contains about 53,000 citations; we used the generalized file-management system, Master Control, which can operate in either an inverted or a linear search mode. The inverted mode uses a table composed of the unique vocabulary contained in one or more data elements, along with all record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs.  For example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus the record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs.  For example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus the record numbers in which each word was found.  (In Master Control, a word is defined as any set of characters bounded on either side by a legal separator such as a blank, period, comma, colon, etc.)  On the other hand, in a linear search mode the data element is compared with the profile word, character by character, which results in a prohibitively time-consuming process for large data bases. We chose the inverted-table technique because of the large amount of data to be searched.  Individual tables were constructed from the titles of the articles, NSA index terms, and titles and index terms combined.  NSA index terms are controlled by the Euratom Thesaurus, as revised for NSA. We used two criteria in the study.  First, the questions had to be of real interest to laboratory personnel.  Some of the questions had actually been submitted by other members of the staff, to be run concurrently on the same data base on an SDI basis.  The others were especially constructed by the authors for this experiment.  Second, citations obtained were to be considered good (or relevant) only if they actually pertained to the subject in question; otherwise, they were to be considered ""false drops,"" regardless of the number of words matched between the profile and the citation."
1437	NATIS: the theme for the 1970s	In this article Stephen Green, a member of the British delegation to the Intergovernmental Conference on the Planning of National Documentation, Library and Archives Infrastructures, gives his views on the results of the conference and its implications for the future development of national information systems (NATIS) in member states.
1168	Analysis of Biological Publication Growth on the Basis of Periodical Sources	The dynamics of the growth of biological publications is investigated.. An analysis of this growth reveals certain uniformities in the evolution of scientific communications, which depend on the field of biology, and discloses the uneven rate of development in the individual fields.. It is concluded that the specialty is a major factor to be taken into account in defining the volume of information necessary for a specialist..
1103	On Information Needs of Different User Categories	The information need and its main properties are defined..  Classification of information needs in different activities is given..  Relationships between information needs and requests are considered, and the process of shaping of information needs and request formulation are traced..  Findings of a study of information utilization by different categories of specialists on the basis of the classification proposed by the author are given..
656	Measures of the Usefulness of Written Technical Information to Chemical Researchers	"The effective transfer of technology involves more than just distributing paper; it demands that useful documents be disseminated with a minimum of useless ones.. For 1 month, 10 researchers recorded a sample of the written technical information items that they received; 4 months later they were interviewed to determine which of these items had proved useful, and in what ways.. The results indicate that (1) a researcher will call an item ""useful"" even if it does not cause him to take some action, but only has some significance for him; (2) the more the source of an item knows about the needs of the researcher or the more the researcher knows about an item he seeks, the more likely it is that the researcher will find the item useful; (3) no strong relationships were found between certain readily observable, physical arrangements and information behavior; and (4) an item may prove useful, not because of the information objectively contained in that item, but because the item causes a cognitive restructuring of the researcher's mind or a ""free association."" Other studies that restrict their measures of information usefulness to externally observable behavior or that do not carefully define usefulness may not be validly representing usefulness to the researcher.."
817	The Aberrystwyth Index Languages Test	Reports a laboratory comparision of the effectiveness and efficiency of five index languages in the subject area of library and information science; three post-co-ordinate languages, Compressed Term, Uncontrolled, and Hierarchically Structured, and two pre-co-ordinate ones, Hierarchically Structures and Relational Indexing.. Eight test comparisons were made, and factors studied were index language specificity and linkage, indexing specificity and exhaustivity, method of co-ordination, the precision devices of partitioning and relational operators, and the provision of context in the search file.. Full details of the test and retrieval results are presented..
1344	Some Correlates of a Citation Measure of Productivity in Science	The Science Citation Index provides an easy way to derive criterion measures of scientific accomplishment.. Measures derived from citation counts, the principal criterion, have high face validity.. These criterion measures are found to have a low but positive correlation with the quality of scientists' graduate education and no relation to his measured IQ score. Plans for future research on the correlates of scientific productivity are briefly discussed..
867	An Algorithm for Compaction of Alphanumeric Data	Description of a technique for compressing data to be placed in computer auxiliary storage.. The technique operates on the principle of taking two alphabetic characters frequently used in combination and replacing them with one unused special character code.. Such one-for-two replacement has enabled the ILO to achieve a rate of compression of 43.5% on a data base of approximately 40,000 bibliographic records..
571	Automatic Abstracting and Indexing.. II. Production of Indicative Abstracts by Application of Contextual Inference and Syntactic Coherence Criteria	Together with the increasing shortage of qualified abstracts, the factors of time, cost and value have lent impetus to a trend toward the automatic generation of abstracts and indexes.. This trend has caused increased emphasis to be placed on the abstract as the locus of data for automatic retrieval systems.. This necessitates the creating of high quality abstracts.. It is the purpose of this paper to report on the development of techniques for the automatic production of high quality abstracts from the full text of the original document.. It is necessary to analyze the conditions under which various methods of sentence selection are successful, in order to develop criteria for selecting sentences to form an abstract.. But clearly, an abstract can be produced by rejecting sentences of the original which are irrelevant to the abstract.. As will be seen, it is this point which is perhaps the most significant contribution of this paper.. Methods of sentence selection and rejection are discussed.. These include contextual inference, intersentence reference, frequency criteria, and coherency considerations.. The automatic abstracting system we have developed consists basically of a dictionary, called the Word Control List, and of a set of rules for implementing certain functions specified for each WCL entry.. The abstracts we have obtained so far are of sufficiently good quality to indicate that large-scale testing of the methods of the automatic abstracting system is warranted..
339	Continuing Library and Information Science Education	"This report and its recommendations are in response to the Commission's request for ""a nationwide program of continuing education for personnel in the library and information science field.""  While it is offered as only the start of an on-going process of developing a nationwide program, its recommendations are the result of an intensive nine-month project, involving hundreds of persons in the library and information science fields. Many of these persons participated in mini-charettes, in a written survey, or in personal interviews which addressed major issues such as: certification; organizational and individual incentives for continuing education; educational methods; and continuing education needs.  The contribution of these library personnel cannot be overstated. Their collective wisdom and perspective have led the Project team to many of its major recommendations.  However, as would be expected when such a large number of people are involved, there were differences of opinion, even as there are many differences of opinion reflected in the literature of continuing education emanating from the various professions.  In the present study, most of these differences related to the input into and control over the policies of the national structure.  Three alternative models which have been considered are outlined in Appendix D; alternatives to several specific features of the recommended model are presented at the end of Chapter 4.  Throughout the text, when issues are presented on which there is uncertainty because of the intensity of opinions expressed, these areas are identified."
994	Measuring Reader Failure at the Catalogue	"In an effort to develop a simple method for librarians to employ to measure and evaluate author catalogue use, the Library Management Research Unit tested a survey design in four varying libraries.. The reader was asked to note details of items not found in the catalogue, the source of the reference, and his status.. The items were then checked by library staff to discover the cause of ""failure"".. Library staff interviewed samples of catalogue users to determine the overall rate of ""failure"", the cooperation (with ""Catalogue Query Slips"") rate, and the action readers proposed to take in order to obtain the item(s) not found in the catalogue.."
87	A Core Nursing Library for Practitioners	The following books and journals for the Core Nursing Library, suggested reference materials, and supplementary books and journals were selected by experts in nursing from all parts of the United States. The purpose is to let practitioners and community hospitals know which books and journals, from a wealth of printed material would, in the opinion of experts, be most useful, especially where funds and space are limited.
652	RELEVANCE: A Review of and a Framework for the Thinking on the Notion in Information Science	Information science emerged as the third subject, along with logic and philosophy, to deal with relevance - an elusive, human notion.. The concern with relevance, as a key notion in information science, is traced to the problems of scientific communication.. Relevance is considered as a measure of the effectiveness of a contact between a source and a destination in a communication process.. The different views of relevance that emerged are interpreted and related within a framework of communication of knowledge.. Different views arose because relevance was considered at a number of different points in the process of knowledge communication.. It is suggested that there exists an interlocking, interplaying cycle of various systems of relevances..
351	Deterioration and Preservation of Library Materials	The deterioration of library materials, constant since libraries began, has accelerated to alarming proportions in 1969.  Researchers have predicted that all paper-based records of this century, as well as those of earlier years,face imminent ruin.  Without new and effective efforts for their preservation, most will not be usable in their present form in the next century.  The danger of destruction threatens not only research library collections but also the world of knowledge and scholarship that they support. For not only paper is involved. Similar dangers of destruction confront other cellulosic products, such as film, which may substitute for paper as the material base of records.  And not only research libraries are involved. The surprisingly rapid deterioration of printed materials, even those that have been produced with some eye to permanence, creates problems and expenses for other libraries as well.
481	Integrated Information Processing and the Case for a National Network	"The various premises, which need consideration when developing a realistic and flexible information storage, retrieval and dissemination (ISRD) system, are discussed; their implication is illustrated with some examples from the development of the system at ""Shell"" Research, Sittingbourne.. One of the factors which will affect the satisfactory performance of an ISRD system is the ease with which relevant literature information not held in the system can be provided.. The later part of the paper is developed to a discussion of this problem and of a possible means of dealing with it in the not too distant future.."
973	The Divided Catalog: A Summary of the Literature	In the earliest item (1905) in the bibliography here presented, Fletcher challenges the right of the dictionary catalog to be the overwhelmingly predominant type of catalog in libraries.  He questions its advocates' claim that it best meets a library's needs.  He advocates a divided catalog such as the one at Amherst because, for one thing, the separate catalog can more readily be used in conjunction with bibliographies in the subject fields.  We find a similar argument in the latest item in the bibliography (Harris, 1957).  Fletcher's article seems to have been followed by more than thirty years of silence in the library journals on the subject of the divided catalog.  During that period there were probably some divisions of catalogs at some libraries but, as Thom (q.v.) indicates, the greatest period of such activity started in 1937.  Our survey of the literature on the divided catalog corroborates this since 1938 in the year in which the steady stream of papers on the subject began.
939	The Paradoxes of Library Cooperation	The need for libraries to cooperate has long been recognized, as countless articles written within the past decade will attest.  Moreover, the necessity to combine forces has never been as apparent as it is today.  Because the cost of self-sufficiency has become undeniably prohibitive, libraries can no longer afford to act as free agents.  Voluntary library cooperation is no natural manifestation of social interaction.  Rhetoric alone is a impotent agent of change.  In truth, cooperative programs succeed only as long as each participant perceives the arrangement as beneficial to his institution.
15	Information Flow in Research and Development Laboratories	"Technical communication patterns in two research and development laboratories were examined using modified sociometric techniques.. The structure of technical communication networks in the two laboratories results from the interaction of both social relations and work structure.. The sociometric ""stars"" in the technical communication network who provide other members of the organization with information either make greater use of individuals outside the organization or read the literature more than other members of the laboratory.."
513	Communication and Information Processing within Scientific Disciplines: Empirical Findings for Psychology	Scientific disciplines can be regarded as social devices which have, as one function, the analysis and reduction of raw information to assimilated knowledge of a type which can be transmitted through professional training.. Data on information flow in psychology reveal feedback to scientific workers and result in refinements of the product of research; later disseminations are interwoven with processes of evaluation and selection and are directed toward the creation of an integrated and tested body of knowledge.. The reported data finish an empirical base for Ziman's consensual model of science and illuminate difficulties which have arisen in the design and implementation of information systems..
127	Use of Machine-Readable Data Bases	"This is the first Annual Review chapter entitled ""Use of Machine- Readable Data Bases.""  Therefore, the coverage provided is for more than a one-year period.  A chapter by Gechman (79) on machine-readable bibliographic data bases included literature from 1969 through 1971.  A chapter by Housman (100) covered the use of data bases for selective dissemination of information (SDI) and a chapter by Parkins & Kennedy (153) has previously reviewed secondary information services.  This chapter will cover the 1973 literature on data bases as well as earlier data base papers not treated in prior chapters. For purposes of this chapter, a data base is considered to be an organized set of machine-readable records containing bibliographic or document-related data."
420	The Automatic Creation of Literature Abstracts	"Experts of technical papers and magazine articles that serve the purposes of conventional abstracts have been created entirely by automatic means.. In the exploratory research described, the complete text of an article in machine- readable form is scanned by an IBM 704 data-processing machine and analyzed in accordance with a standard program..  Statistical information derived from word frequency and distribution is used by the machine to compute a relative measure of significance, first for individual words and then for sentences.. Sentences scoring highest in significance are extracted and printed out to become the ""auto-abstract"".."
1341	Communication Nets in Science: Status and Citation Patterns in Animal Physiology	By virtue of its peculiar links with the reward system in science, the communication system plays a central part in the maintenance and growth of science.  It is the means by which the individual scientist relates to the social system:  he publishes his work to gain recognition, and reads the publications of others to maintain his knowledge.  The formal communication system also forms the basis for the allocation of rewards: instrumental and consumatory.  Thus it is a means of exercising social control. The informal communication system, although important, is the distaff side.  Its recognition is personal with more immediate and consumatory rewards.  Legitimation of objective or methods of work is rarely given by the social system through informal systems of communication, though it is growing in importance as an information dissemination system.
1255	Report on the Testing and Analysis of an Investigation into the Comparative Efficiency of Indexing Systems	"This volume continues the account of the Aslib-Cranfield project as given in the ""Final Report of the First Stage of an Investigation into the Comparative Efficiency of Indexing Systems"".  The major portion of the two years spent on this present stage has been involved with the analysis of the considerable amount of data which was obtained from the main test programme.  A difficulty in this work was in deciding on the type of analysis which would be most likely to yield valuable information.  In order to keep this volume within reasonable limits, it has been necessary to select from the analysis that was done, and even so in many cases only brief examples are given.  The major emphasis has been placed on the reasons for failure to retrieve source documents, for this is considered to give some of the most interesting results of the project and has not, to our knowledge, been previously attempted.  Of possible equal importance, but certainly more difficult to evaluate, is the reason for the retrieval of non-relevant references.  This analysis has not been attempted within the present work, but will be one of the matters to be investigated in the continuation of the project."
566	Semantic Clustering of Index Terms	A computer procedure to recognize indexing vocabularies is described..Index terms are drawn from the vocabulary of a structured indexing system and may consist of single words, collection of words, or syntactic phrases.. The basic idea is that a measure of the semantic association between index terms can be determined from the structural relationships which the terms exhibit by their relative positions in the system.. The association measure, which is based on a priori (preassigned) semantic relationships between terms, rather than their co-occurrence in a document corpus, is then for grouping index terms into clusters or concepts.. Some results of an experimental investigation are presented.. Information, retrieval, clustering, index terms, semantic, graphs, clusters, associations, synonyms, subgraphs, complete, maximal, connected, component, relevance measure, vocabulary, indexing systems, cliques..
157	On the Design of Information Systems for Human Beings	Planning of any kind can be motivated by a pressing practical problem which has to be solved - for example, an increasing number of people may have to be housed in the same area; or by a long-term idealistic vision; or by both (the idealist seeing the long-term implications of an immediate problem).  In short-term planning, the danger exists that the more technical problems may be solved, without attention to their implications for human beings; to take my housing example, higher and higher flats may be built, without considering the possible effects (e.g. the effect on social groupings).  In long-term planning, Utopian or ideological blueprints may be produced.
215	Selected Reference Aids for Small Medical Libraries	This annotated list of 178 items is compiled as a guide to the development of the reference collection in a small medical library.. Arrangement, following the pattern of the previous revision, is by broad subject groups.. Titles are chiefly in English.. Textbooks in subject fields have been omitted since these are covered adequately in several comprehensive guides to the literature..
1399	Syntactic Structures	This study deals with syntactic structure both in the broad sense (as opposed to semantics) and the narrow sense (as opposed to phonemics and morphology).  It forms part of an attempt to construct a formalized general theory of linguistic structure and to explore the foundations of such a theory.  The search for rigorous formulation in linguistics has a much more serious motivation than mere concern for logical niceties or the desire to purify well-established methods of linguistic analysis.  Precisely constructed models for linguistic structure can play an important role, both negative and positive, in the process of discovery itself.  By pushing a precise but inadequate formulation to an unacceptable conclusion, we can often expose the exact source of this inadequacy and, consequently, gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic data.  More positively, a formalized theory may automatically provide solutions for many problems other than those for which it was explicitly designed. Obscure and intuition-bound notions can neither lead to absurd conclusions nor provide new and correct ones, and hence they fail to be useful in two important respects.
582	Title Indexes as Alerting Services in the Chemical and Life Sciences	The principles underlying alerting services are discussed.. General alerting services (as distinct from SDI systems) need to transfer to their users a large quantity of current but mainly irrelevent information as speedily as possible.. As title indexes are the easiest to prepare and are therefore common, the user needs to know how much significant information is not discernible from a documents title.. This is estimated to be 20-25% but can vary with subject and type of information sought.. If a search of, say, Chemical Titles is made, ignoring synonyms but allowing for all syntactical variants, only about one third of the significant information will be recovered.. Synonyms and other nomenclature problems are discussed.. Delay times and time of use are the two most important factors in evaluating an alerting service and are reviewed for some typical services..
1261	The Ring Index	"The collection includes (1) simple parent rings and (2) parent systems of more than one ring in which the rings are united by having one or more atoms in common.  It thus comparizes simple and ""fused"" (ortho- and ortho-peri-fused), or annelated, systems (including spiro forms),  but not systems like biphenyl or triphenylmethane, in which the rings are united only by valences or by atoms not belonging to the rings.  Some systems are included in which a polar valence is involved, e.g. the four-membered ring of betaine, since these are often shown in formulas as if true rings; but in such cases the presence of the polar bond is noted.  Polar bonds in metallic salts (e.g. calcium succinate) are disregarded as ring formers; so also are coordinate linkages (as in the chelate compounds).  The word ""system"" is used to mean a single ring or a combination of rings united one to another by atoms common to both. Except for some special reason, only systems representing known compounds of generally accepted structure, or definitely believed by authors to have a certain structure, are included.  The fact that a compound must have one or two alternative structures is not sufficient for the entry of a system based on either of them.  Where there is doubt about an entry a query (?) is inserted after the reference."
577	Probabilistic Models for Automatic Indexing	This paper is developed in two stages.  The first stage describes an experiment that explores properties of the class of words that are not useful in conveying subject meaning and distinguishes them from those classes of words that do convey subject meaning to various degrees.  In particular, we study the clustering properties of these words; the analysis is based on statistical properties alone, and techniques are introduced that may be of value in other areas of information science.  On the basis of the results of this experiment, a model of word occurrences is introduced and discussed.  Later papers by us and by Harter will apply this model to indexing.
650	Relative Effectiveness of Titles, Abstracts, and Subject Headings for Machine Retrieval from the COMPENDEX Services	We have investigated the relative merits of searching on titles, subject headings, abstracts, free-language terms, and combinations of these elements.. The COMPENDEX data base  was used for this study since it contained all of the data elements of interest.. In general, the results obtained from the experiments indicate that, as expected, titles alone are not satisfactory for efficient retrieval.. The combination of titles and abstracts came the closest to 100% retrieval, with searching of abstracts alone doing almost as well.. Indexer input, although necessary for 100% retrieval in almost all cases, was found to be relatively unimportant..
809	A Single Computer-Based System for Both Current Awareness and Retrospective Search: Operating Experience with ASSASSIN	ASSASSIN as designed and operated by ICI Agricultural Division, provides from a single paper tape input a current awareness service by SDI and a retrospective search both by a weighted term machine search and printed KWOC-type indexes.. Programs for producing structured thesauri are part of the package.. Input is in the form of abstracts from both published and internal source.. The system has operated for more than a year at the Agricultural Division and is currently in use at five other locations.. Flexibility of the package is demonstrated by the variety of applications.. This paper outlines the various applications and shows how a single package may be used complete, or in part, or with modification.. Machine costs are given for the major application.. The system was designed with the possible input of externally produced machine readable data in mind.. The intended application of the package in conjunction with tapes such as those of the Institute for Scientific Information source and Chemical Abstracts Condensates is outlined..
1429	The Universal Decimal Classification	Purpose of this paper.  The purpose of this preliminary study is to attempt to discover how far it succeeds at present and how far and by what methods it may continue to succeed or be made to succeed in the future.  One person (or two, for Brian Vickery is tackling the problem from the point of view of scientific and technological users) with however many helpful consultants can only hope to isolate some of the problems and to indicate some of the possible solutions.  This, it is hoped, may prepare the ground and stimulate the critical and creative efforts of others towards fruitful developments.
922	Library Catalogs:  their preservation and maintenance by photographic and automated techniques; a study	The major conclusions and recommendations of the study which follows are: That the catalogs of The Research Libraries of the New York Public Library be divided chronologically at the earliest possible date; That the present (or retrospective) Public Catalog be reproduced photographically in book form; That the future (or prospective) catalogs be produced in a combination of card and book form from a store of machine-readable data; That a Central Serial Record be created to contain acquisition information, cataloging and holdings data, and bindery records for all serial publications in The Research Libraries.
330	Computer Readable Bibliographic Data Bases -- A Directory and Data Sourcebook	"This document, Computer Readable Bibliographic Data Bases -- A Directory and Data Sourcebook not only updates the 1973 publication, which included information on 81 data bases, but expands the coverage to 300 data bases and includes considerably more information about the data bases. Methodology used to obtain data involved:  (1) consulting published and unpublished sources; (2) design of a 13 page questionnaire; (3) mail survey; and (4) telephone follow up and verification.  The sources consulted were (1) the Survey of Commercially Available Computer-Readable Bibliographic Data Bases; (2) M.E. Williams' personal data base files which include information from the open literature, news releases, and personal contacts; (3) NEWSIDIC, April 1975 issue number 16, the quarterly newsletter produced by EUSIDIC which included a survey of computer readable bibliographic files; (4) the ""World Inventory of Abstracting and Indexing Services--Data Elements Definition List;"" and (5) the ASIDIC Survey of Information Center Services."
404	A Guide to the Library of Congress Classification	This guide is an introduction to the Library of Congress Classification; as such, it does not include instructions for every subclass or table, but attempts to provide the reader with an understanding of the characteristics of the classification, the arrangement within the classes, the format of the schedules and tables, and special problems of use and notation.  The reader should trace the analysis of each example of classing through the pages from the L.C. schedule provided in the guide.  It is important to remind the reader that a thorough study of each class schedule in addition to the recommended readings is essential.  The author realizes that many imperfections may be present in this guide and will appreciate suggestions for changes from readers.
586	An Evaluation of Index Medicus and MEDLARS in the Field of Ophthalmology	An evaluation of the performance of Index Medicus and MEDLARS in the field of ophthalmology is presented, using data generated by a separate study.. MEDLARS performance figures gave a screened precision ratio of 54% and a recall ratio of 42%.. Over the same set of questions Index Medicus had a screened precision ratio of 53% and a recall ratio of 46%.. Results for Index Medicus alone over a large set of questions gave a 73% screened precision ratio and a 47% recall ratio.. A random sample of MEDLARS and Index Medicus precision and recall failures showed that most of the Index Medicus recall failures resulted from manual searcher omission.. The major causes of Medlars precision failures were inadequate indexing terminalogy to express concepts and attempts at providing too exhaustive a search..
918	Library of Congress	The book was built on interviews with the Library's middle managers, on discussions with working specialists in the various divisions, on conversations with and questionnaires sent to out-of-Library users, and from my own observations through almost twenty-five years in the Library's Congressional Research Service.  After the text was completed, it was read by appropriate people in each department for factual content and ultimately by the staff in the Librarian's Office for their comment.  At no point was there pressure to change text or conclusions - although there were plenty of good-natured suggestions on details, and nearly everyone urged a fuller description of his own particular specialty!
1207	Technical Information Project	The model of a technical information system described there by Dr. Kessler involves a working literature taken from twenty-one journals in the field of physics.. The system, designed and constructed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a prototype operating in a realistic test environment, uses remote consoles having access to a time-sharing computer facility.. Programs have been developed for a large variety of search and processing techniques in real time as well as for delayed output.. The work is supported by the National Science Foundation and in part by Project MAC, the experimental computer facility at MIT which is sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency..
837	Information Requirements in the Social Sciences: Some Preliminary Considerations	Information requirements in the social sciences are almost entirely unexplored.. I shall argue that exploration is desirable; discuss some of the reasons why this is so; attempt an analysis of the factors to be investigated; and consider some possible methods of investigation.. This article is an early by-product of the Investigation into Information Requirements of the Social Sciences, being carried out by two researchers under my direction,and supported by the Office for Scientific and Technical Information.. It is based on the Report on the Preliminary Stage, presented to OSTI in April, 1968..
984	Cost Analysis Studies in Libraries: Is There a Basis for Comparison?	When the Chairman of the Technical Services Cost Committee asked the three of us to summarize the findings of the Colorado study on centralized processing, I agreed.  Later, I began to have second thoughts - I suppose because we were almost buried under an avalanche of data and it soon became apparent that we could not really summarize the findings of the study in one evening. The investigation took off in tangents that had not been originally anticipated.  As you have already been informed, the final report deals with such diverse topics as a faculty user attitude survey, mathematical model simulations of processing center operations, approval plan utilization, and an inter-institutional bookkeeping system, all in addition to the cost studies of acquisitions and cataloging in nine libraries.
1319	Scientific and Technological Communication	"My objective in this work has been to try to get at the fundamental aspects of the elements and media of scientific and technological communication and to describe the critical issues involving them as well as the opportunities and techniques for exploiting them which hopefully could aid both the ""users"" and the ""handlers"" of these important resources."
637	Breaking the Communication barrier Between Searcher and Literature File: An Interactive Guide	The challenges of design of programming systems, file organization and manipulation, and user-oriented query languages have held the spotlight in the development of data processing support to systems for retrieval of scientific literature.. At BIOSIS, development of such a system from the pragmatic viewpoint of providing viable self-supporting retrieval service from a data base of more than two million references has resulted in focusing attention on supporting the formulation of the information need into an effective computer search specification.. Developed under CPS and now implemented under CICS, the program claims no novelty of structure or technique, but constitutes an innovation in application and goal with primary emphasis on accommodating the behavior of a user not previously knowledgeable about the structure, indexing language, and detailed content of a machine based references file..
717	Current Information Dissemination: Ideas and Practices	A detailed description and a tabulated summary of the salient feature of 17 current awareness information services are presented to illustrate various approaches to handling the current information dissemination problem..
873	Content Designators for Machine-Readable Records: A Working Paper	"Under the auspices of the International Federation of Library Association's Committees on Cataloging and Mechanization, an International Working Group on Content Designators was formed to attempt to resolve the differences in the content designators assigned by national agencies to their machine-readable bibliographic records.. All working papers emanating from the IFLA Working Group will be submitted to the International Standards Organization Technical Committee 46, Subcommittee 4, Working Group on Content Designators.. Prior to any attempt to standardize the content designators for the international exchange of bibliographic data in machine-readable form, it is necessary to agree on certain basic points from which all future work will be derived.. This first working paper is a statement of: 1) the obstacles that presently exist which prevent the effective international interchange of bibliographic data in machine-readable form; 2) the score of concern for the IFLA Working Group; and 3) the definition of terms included in the broader term ""content designators"".. If an international standard format can be derived, it would greatly facilitate the use in this country of machine-readable bibliographic records issued by other national agencies.. It should also contribute significantly to the expansion of MARC to other languages by the Library of Congress.."
510	Retrieval Efficiency from Titles and the Cost of Indexing	By the means of the flexible machine search system three experiments have been made in order to test the retrieval efficiency of searching free text and keywords.. Base upon the relevance judgements of the users, the results indicate that titles and abstracts are good index material which can be used for machine searching without human indexing in the three fields studies..
1247	Reader in Library Cooperation	This volume is intended as a means of exploration for the practicing librarian and as a textbook for the library school student.  It will try to draw attention to significant social, behavioral, theoretical, organizational, functional, and operational generalizations about library interrelationships; and to suggest a sense of the total fabric of the cooperative endeavor.  It does not aim at identifying and incorporating the forms and the range of library cooperation in which individual libraries seek to extend the limits of their separate capabilities.
204	Analysis of Recorded Biomedical Book and Journal Use in the Yale Medical Library Part II. Subject and User Relations	Cancelled charge slips collected over a one-year period supply the data for this analysis of circulation in the Yale Medical Library.. Full-time teacher faculty are the heaviest users of journal literature, and  students, of monograph literature.. Faculties of Medical School departments are compared in terms of their use of material in individual subjects.. Subject literatures are analyzed in terms of groups of users borrowing from them.. The extent to which journal titles used by medical students  are also used by Medical School faculty is examined.. One of the products of the study is a rank list of journal titles used in the Library.. Results are presented in several tables..
401	Future Shock	"This is a book about what happens to people when they are overwhelmed by change.  It is about the ways in which we adapt - or fail to adapt - to the future. Much has been written about the future.  Yet, for the most part, books about the world to come sound a harsh metallic note. These pages, by contrast, concern themselves with the ""soft"" or human side of tomorrow.  Moreover, they concern themselves with the steps by which we are likely to reach tomorrow. They deal with common, everyday matters - the products we buy and discard, the places we leave behind, the corporations we inhabit, the people who pass at an ever faster clip through our lives.  The future of friendship and family life in probed.  Strange new subcultures and life styles are investigated, along with an array of other subjects from politics and playgrounds to skydiving and sex."
715	Articulation in the Generation of Subject Indexes by computer	"A simple and logical model for the automatic generation of subject indexes from title like phrases is described, and its advantages and disadvantages are discussed.	It is based on recent studies of the structure of articulated subject indexes, such as those to Chemical Abstracts.  The model employs the prepositions and connectives of phrases of simple structure as articulating points, and selects from all possible forms of entries those which lead to optimal organization in an index.  The technique is illustrated with part of an index to a recent abstracting journal.  The wide variety of controls which can be exerted by the indexer and the program is discussed."
63	The Publication Inflation	"The much-vaunted information explosion seems to be the manifestation of a rather generalized publication inflation.. Multipublication and pretentious writing have become obstacles to ""communication between human minds"". To counteract their harmful effects it will be necessary to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of the printed records by filtering the material before it is stored for retrieval.."
617	On-Line  Serials Control System in a Large Biomedical Library; 1) Description of the System	An on-line serials control system with particular emphasis on storage and maintenance concepts is described.. The system, operational since January, 1971, has evolved from a former batch card system and remains completely compatible with it.. The system allows real-time display and updating of all elements of the file.. Consequently all check-in, bindery, and claims operations, as well as new entries and data field changes are accomplished on a real-time basis.. All programs are in PL/1.. Required equipment is an IBM time-shared facility with 100 K memory available for the applications programs, and IBM 2260 display units.. This article is the first of three.. The second is concerned with an analysis of inverted file retrieval features and the third compares the operation of the on-line with the batch system, comparable manual operations, and discusses costs..
1236	Public Libraries in Cooperative Systems; Administrative patterns for service	"This book was written as an introduction to the administrative relationships between small and medium-sized public libraries and the cooperative library system.  In this book, the definition of a cooperative system is as follows:  A cooperative library system is the combining of the talents and the resources of a group of independent libraries, within a reasonable geographic radius, for the purpose of attaining excellence in service and resources for the benefit of the actual and potential users of all the member libraries.  The plan for the book originated with questions directed to a public library administrator and to a system director.  The most pertinent of the repeated questions was, ""How does system membership change local library administration?""  The sharpest question was, ""Will the system ultimately take over local rights and responsibilities?"""
690	Experience with the Mechanized Chemical and Biological Information Retrieval System	New computer methods have been developed in associations with the drug development programs of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.  Experiences with these systems are recounted.  Special input devices and computer programming have been developed for the input and retrieval of conventional chemical structural diagrams.  The costs, operation, and the advantages of this system are discussed.  Associated files of biological properties and inventory control information have been created, which are searchable.  The methods used in creating consolidated listings of selected chemical compounds and associated biological data are discussed.
970	Fields of Information on Library of Congress Catalog Cards: Analysis of a Random Sample, 1950-1964	"The Information Systems Office (ISO) of the Library of Congress has as its mission the development and implementation of the main automation program for the Library and the co-ordination of all LC automation efforts. One of the primary activities in this effort is a system-development study concentrating on the central bibliographic operations, that is, acquisitions, cataloging, reference, etc.  This study is now in its early stages, and it is too soon to predict the actual system that will evolve. As an adjunct to this study an analysis of the potential uses of and problems involved in the machine processing of cataloging data was begun.  One aspect of the analysis was the design of a preliminary machine- readable catalog record.  The results of this work are in a report issued by the ISO as its ""Planning Memorandum Number 3."""
991	Filing Arrangement in the Library of Congress Catalogs	New filing rules have been developed for the catalogs of the Library of Congress to ease the tasks of filers and users and to pave the way for computer-assisted filing.. This article discusses preliminary considerations about the functions of large bibliographic files,the complexities of cataloging, the interaction between users and catalogs, and ways to simplify arrangements.. The assumptions and principles that underlie the proposed rules are stated, and their organization and anticipated use are described.. An abridged version of the rules is illustrated by an extended example..
1165	Issues in the informational analysis of documents.	In scientific process and primary scientific documents there are objective characteristics, which allow the accurate and unambiguous reflection of the form and content of primary statements n the informational analysis of their secondary pattern. Using these characteristics allows one to develop a model of standardized bibliographic and abstract document description and minimize subjectivity in information analysis. The objective characteristics of form and content of documents and corresponding elements of bibliographic and abstractive description must be based on application of classification schemes. For each characteristic there must be a corresponding scheme of particular structural complexity.
1014	The Microform Revolution	"Librarians have tried replacing some of their books and journal files with microfilm copies or other microforms in order to save valuable space in the bookstacks, instead of or in addition to extension of the stack area, decentralization, compact shelving, separate storage warehouse, or any of the other solutions to the storage problem discussed in earlier chapters.  As a final paper, this solution for the storage of library materials will be discussed.  Although the distinct forms will not often be designated, ""microform"" is used here to mean the four forms most common in the United States: 35 mm. roll microfilm, microfiche (now standardized in the United States and Great Britain at 4 by 6 inches) and the two micro-opaque forms - 3 by 5 inch Microcard, and 6 by 9 inch Microprint."
212	Thesaural Problems in an On-Line System	This paper describes the construction of a synonym thesaurus or entry vocabulary for the SUNY Biomedical Communication Network, which will permit the user greater ease of access to MeSH-indexed material without previously consulting a printed list of indexed terms.. In order to discover the actual terminalogy used by a researcher, words were extracted from titles of articles appearing in Index Medicus, and compared with the subject heading under which they appeared.. As well as strict synonyms, grammatical variants were also included.. Work is continuing on relating other indexing vocabularies, such as Excerpta Medica and Current Medical Terminalogy, used in the biomedical world to MeSH terms..
1299	Current Physics Information	A new concept in science communication will be given its first test in calendar year 1972.. Primary and secondary contents of a selected subset of the world's journal literature in physics will be provided in a variety of output formats.. Among them are a monthly microfilm containing the full texts of all articles in the set of journals (Current Physics Microform); an advance abstracts journal describing the articles (Current Physics Advance Abstracts); a printed, classified index of the titles of the articles (Current Physics Titles); and a computer tape index to the articles (Searchable Physics Information Notices)..
391	Factors in the Transfer of Technology	The strong correlation between the scope and depth of this country's research and development activities and the vigor and the growth of its industrial plant is today a widely accepted fact.  Government expenditures for research and development have increased from a modest annual rate of $200 million some thirty years ago to $17 billion today. The research budgets of the private sector of the economy, which were almost miniscule in the 1930's, total approximately $8 billion today. These expenditures have had their many tangible and visible results, ranging from nylon and antibiotics to radar and solid state electronics, but what is not so generally appreciated is the additional product represented by the increasing inventory of ideas and new knowledge whose application, for the most part, is still a potential one.  The sophisticated and often urgent nature of some of the larger products in which we engage today, which require vast research expenditures to find the efficient way, or the economical way, or the safe way, or the most accurate way to accomplish some end purpose, also produces an increase in the national level of scientific and technological competence that has not yet been transferred into the civilian economy.  The value of the technical ideas now stored and awaiting application can be estimated as a value many times larger than the annual rate of billions of dollars invested in the effort it took to develop this increased technical capability.  As a national resource for underwriting further economic and industrial development, this technical inventory is a factor of major importance.
309	The SMART Automatic Document Retrieval System - An Illustration	A fully automatic document retrieval system operating on the IBM 7094 is described.. The system is characterized by the fact that several hundred different  methods are available to analyze  documents and search requests.. This feature is used in the retrieval process by leaving the exact sequence of operations initially unspecified, and adapting the search strategy to the needs of individual users.. The system is used not only to simulate an actual operating environment, but also to test the effectiveness of the various available processing methods.. Results obtained so far seem to indicate that some combination of analysis procedures can in general be relied upon to retrieve the wanted information.. A typical search request is used as an example in the present  report to illustrate systems operations  and evaluation procedures..
798	The Thesaurofacet: A Multipurpose Retrieval Language Tool	A description is given of the English Electric 'Thesaurofacet', a faceted classification and thesaurus covering engineering and related scientific, technical, and management subjects.. A novel feature of the system is the integration of the classification schedules and thesaurus.. Each term appears both in the thesaurus and in the schedules.. In the schedules the term is displayed in the most appropriate facet and hierarchy: the thesaurus supplements this information by indicating alternative hierarchies and other relationships which cut across the classified arrangement.. The thesaurus also controls word forms and synonyms and acts as the alphabetical index to the class numbers.. The resulting tool is multipurpose, as easily applicable to shelf arrangement and conventional classified card catalogues as to co-ordinate indexing and computerized retrieval systems.. The reasons are given for modifying certain traditional facet techniques, including the choice of traditional disciplines for main classes, the lack of a 'built-in' preferred order, and the use, in certain instances, of enumeration rather than synthesis to express multi-term concepts.. Methods of application of the Thesaurofacet in pre-coordinate and post-coordinate systems are discussed and brief account is given of the techniques employed in its compilation..
296	Participative Management in Relation to Library Effectiveness	This paper reviews a recent study on the influence of participative management on library performance.. Because most of the recent theoretical and empirical research being done in this area is ignored and an invalid measure of participation in decision making is used, the study provides no basis for the generalization that in increase in the library staff's participation in decision making will increase the library's effectiveness..
29	"Some Questions Concerning ""Information Need"""	"The expression ""satisfying a requester's information need"" is often used, but its meaning is obscure.  The literature on ""information need"" in relation to retrieval suggests three different (though not inconsistent) possible interpretations.  However, each of these interpretations is itself fundamentally unclear. The various obscurities involved are indicated by critical questions, which those who write of information need are invited to answer."
1355	Rational Selection of Primary Journals for a Biomedical Research Library: The Use of Secondary Journal Citation	"After considering several different methods, it was concluded that primary journals for coverage of a given field can be selected rationally on the basis of their citation frequencies in an appropriate secondary journal.  Results obtained on the example used, ""rehabilitation"" as cited in Index Medicus during the years 1968-1971, were similar to those from five other fields, in that the number of journals required for each percent gain in literature coverage increased exponentially as the percentage of literature itself increased.  As a consequence, library coverage of any particular field can be specified as a function of its budgeting commitment, so that the maximum percent coverage will be obtained for each dollar spent."
687	Index Chemicus Registry System:  Pragmatic Approach to Substructure Chemical Retrieval	"The Index Chemicus Registry System (ICRS), launched in 1968 with the support of a dozen industrial and governmental organizations, is now a current operational monthly service.  Subscribers receive magnetic tapes and printouts, in which the weekly issues of Index Chemicus (IC) have been encoded in Wiswesser Line Notations (WLN).  Over 13,000 compounds per month are provided in machine language.  The canonical WLN is also provided in alphabetized printouts. Encoding of over 400,000 new chemical compounds from IC has already been completed, including all those reported in 1967, 1968, and 1969.  Since the tapes also include title and other bibliographic information, this paper describes the use of supporting software provided for SDI search systems employing ""word"" and other searching terms, in addition to the WLN fragments. Use of the monthly and annual printouts are illustrated for those searches which do not require computer manipulation."
731	Evaluation of an SDI Service Based on the Index Chemicus Registry System	The Index Chemicus Registry System (ICRS) is the machine-readable equivalent of Current Abstracts in Chemistry & Index Chemicus (CAC & IC).  In an earlier paper, we described the development of an experimental selective-dissemination-of-information (SDI) service based on these tapes.  A detailed description of the techniques of profile construction for searching a Wiswesser Line Notation (WLN) structure file is given in this earlier paper.  The present paper describes the evaluation of the SDI service in terms both of quantitative measures of retrieval performance, coverage and currency, and also of user reactions to the service, as expressed in their replies to a questionnaire.  Failure analysis techniques were used to identify the reasons for retrieval failures and possible methods for improving retrieval performance.  A fuller description of the evaluation has been published in report form.
120	Design and Evaluation of Information Systems	In corresponding chapters of earlier volumes of this review may be discerned a trend toward progressive broadening of content coverage.  The initial emphasis was on design and evaluation concepts and on techniques that were rather closely - and narrowly - connected with information storage and retrieval systems.  It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that there are many activities and ideas outside of this context that have, or can have, a very important bearing on the work of systems analysts, designers, and evaluators working on library and documentation systems.  This chapter attempts to continue enlarging our perception of the range of reported activities that can help to improve the kinds of systems in which our readers are chiefly interested.
1397	Survey of the Interlibrary Loan Operation of the National Library of Medicine	This paper reports a survey of the interlibrary loan operations at the National Library of Medicine. The operations discussed here represent a significant departure from conventional interlibrary loan routines.  The substance of the present report pertains to the handling of interlibrary loans through the instrumentality of photoduplication.  This concept - providing photoduplicates of desired materials in lieu of loaning the originals - stems from thinking enunciated by Atherton Seidell, a member of the Friends of the Army Medical Library who pioneered in the development of photoduplication services.
343	A Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge	On almost all the occasions when we turn explicitly to the same problems, Sir Karl's view of science and my own are very nearly identical.  We are both concerned with the dynamic process by which scientific knowledge is acquired rather than with the logical structure of the products of scientific research.  Given that concern, both of us emphasize, as legitimate data the facts and also the spirit of actual scientific life, and both of us turn often to history to find them.  From this pool of shared data, we draw many of the same conclusions.  Both of us reject the view that science progresses by accretion; both emphasize instead the revolutionary process by which an older theory is rejected and replaced by an incompatible new one; and both deeply underscore the role played in this process by the older theory's occasional failure to meet challenges posed by logic, experiment, or observation.  Finally, Sir Karl and I are united in opposition to a number of classical positivism's most characteristic theses.  We both emphasize, for example, the intimate and inevitable entanglement of scientific observation with scientific theory; we are correspondingly sceptical of efforts to produce any neutral observation language; and we both insist that scientists may properly aim to invent theories that explain observed phenomena and that do so in terms of real objects, whatever the latter phrase may mean.
437	Industry and Technical Progress	This book is written in the belief that the full and speedy application of science in industry is necessary to economic progress, and should indeed be one of the most important objectives of national policy.  This being so, it is important to identify the hindrances to speedy application.  Many people have already drawn attention to particular hindrances but the three bodies which have sponsored this report did not consider that there was any up-to-date assessment of the problem which attempted to look at it as a whole, in all its variety and complexity. Hence the investigation which they undertook, and largely entrusted to us; an investigation which, through the great goodwill of many people in British industry, has yielded so much material that this book can only be a first impression and summary.
1390	A Study of the Characteristics, Cost and Magnitude of Interlibrary Loans in Academic Libraries	The investigation of interlibrary loans among academic libraries was initiated by the Interlibrary Loan Study Committee of the Association of Research Libraries.  It was seen as a fundamental first step toward the solution of current problems and the exploration of the means to improve interlibrary loan services nationally.  This report provides solid information that is basic to any future planning at the national level.
108	Productivity Differences among Scientists: Evidence for Accumulative Advantage	The highly skewed distributions of productivity among scientists can be partly explained by a process of accumulative advantage.. Because of feedback through recognition and resources, highly productive scientists maintain or increase their productivity, while scientists who produce very little produce even less later on.. A major implication of accumulative advantage is that the distribution of productivity becomes increasingly unequal as a cohort of scientists ages.. Cross-sectional survey data support this hypothesis for chemists, physicists, and mathematicians, who show strong linear increases in inequality with increasing career age.. This increase is highly associated with a changing distribution of time spent on research.. Another implication of accumulative advantage is also corroborated: the association among productivity, resources and esteem increases as career age increases..
616	A Bibliometric Analysis of Certain Information Science Literature	Several bibliometric techniques previously applied to separate scientific literatures were used together in the analysis of a single corpus of journal articles relating to information science.. Techniques included are (a) Bradford analysis, (b) epidemic analysis, (c) identification of research front, and (d) bibliographic coupling.. Similar analysis was made of writings cited by the main corpus articles, and of the literature which in turn cites the main corpus.. Results were analyzed in terms of structure and processes observable in patterns of authorship, publication, and citation.. Their significance is discussed with potential application of the method to the solution of problems in the management of large research libraries..
7	Academic Library Buildings A Guide to Architectural Issues and Solutions	This book attempts to present representative examples of successful architectural solutions to the important problems librarians and architects face in planning new college and university library buildings or in remodeling and enlarging existing structures.  It does not attempt to make case study evaluations, as was done by Ellsworth Mason for Brown and Yale.  Nor does it present examples of unsuccessful solutions except to show how to avoid mistakes, and in these cases the libraries will not be identified.
1250	Reader in Research Methods for Librarianship	The fundamental purpose of this volume is to assist its reader to genuinely perceive the nature of scholarship and its relationship to the goals of librarianship.  Viewed in this way, and perhaps as antidote to the more rigidly formalistic treatments of the technical matters of research, the editors' concern here has been less with the rituals and far more with the fundamental nature of intellectual inquiry and its societal contribution, with the modes of analysis, the habits of thought and expression which characterize scholarship and the scholar. Another primary purpose has been to put research into a context which clearly depicts the task of the researcher, and so illuminates realistically not only the rigor and the discipline, but the human triumphs and joys which derive from its accomplishment.  Seen thus, as a dynamic field fit for the adventurer of the mind, perhaps it may succeed in enticing more to its fold from among those in librarianship with imaginative and creative capacity, who have not before held this perspective of research.
718	Critical Reviews: Introductory Remarks	Critical reviews are examined in terms of the quality and quantity of their present production and the measure of their value and utility to scientists in meeting information needs..The paper presented the viewpoint of user, sponsor, author, and editor, and discuss present problems and possible future solutions..
575	A Decision Theory View of the Information Retrieval Situation: An Operations Research Approach	A decision theory approach is used to model the information retrieval decision problem of which documents to retrieve from a library collection in response to a specific user query for information.. A thorough discussion of decision theory, including the components of the alternatives,states-of-nature, outcomes, and evaluations - as well as of the optimization process under the cases of certainty, risk, and uncertainty - is presented.. Bayesian statistics are also discussed to show how prior information about the various documents via classification analysis can affect the decision process under risk.. An example problem is used to illustrate the decision theory approach and to compare tha overall performance of the retrieval system under risk with and without document classification information.. Thus, the operations research technique of decision theory is used to model the retrieval decision process, illustrate how important evaluation is, and to demonstrate the value of prior information via document classification analysis.. Moreover, the paper presents, in a somewhat tutorial mode, an overall framework for considering the information retrieval decision problem, incorporating the aspects of cost-effectiveness and alternative evaluation, which allows one to better understand the contributions made by many researchers in this crucial area..
147	Research on Users' Needs: Where is it Getting Us?	Since Bernal made his pilot survey of the use of scientific literature for the 1948 Royal Society Scientific Information Conference, at least three dozen other investigations have been reported of the needs of scientists and engineers for information, of their information gathering habits, and the use to which they put information. Some of these have been concerned with the people in individual organizations, but have implications elsewhere.  Others, including Aslib's own investigations, have had wider aims.  Some have been based upon observations and records of what the scientists and engineers themselves did or said, and some upon records of the demands they made upon libraries.  There have been both surveys of opinions, and collections of facts.
674	Installation and Operation of a Registry for Chemical Compounds	Since 1958 the Chemical Abstracts Service has been working toward establishing a computer-based system for handling chemical information.  Briefly, the concept of the CAS system consists of sets of special subject files in the following categories: (1) physical properties, (2) chemical reactivities, (3) biochemical activities, and (4) applications.  With the importance of compounds in correlation studies, and the need to interrelate compounds and the huge collections of chemical and other data, a highly developed subsystem, called the Registry System, for handling compounds must be the first step in the actual operation of an over-all computer-based service. The Registry System will include files of compounds interconnected with files of associated data that permit identifying the compounds and retrieving them from the files.
288	An Approach to Performance Budgeting at the Florida Atlantic University Library	The article summarizes the problems encountered at the FAU library in the 1967 and the library's subsequent reorganization.. A detailed cost study is analyzed and the Clapp-Jordan and University of Washington formulae for budgeting are described, as well as a modified formula.. The resulting program performance budgeting system is now in use by the state university of Florida..
1081	Generalization of Epidemic Theory An Application to the Transmission of Ideas	One of the most fundamental problems in the field of information retrieval is that of determining the circumstances under which it might be necessary to introduce an information retrieval system as an aid to a given population of scientists.  It is proposed that this problem be examined in terms of the transmission and development of ideas within a population.  Specifically, the transmission of ideas within a population will be treated as if it were the transmission of an infectious disease, that is, in terms of an epidemic process. An attempt will be made to indicate the role of information retrieval in the development of such a process.
775	The Citation Characteristics of Astronomical Research Literature	The citation characteristic of papers in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (especially for the years 1963-5) have been examined as a means of studying the usage of astronomical literature in the United Kingdom.. The decrease of usage with age has been investigated and the decay half-life determined.. Particular attention has been paid to the immediacy affect, and to its possible variation in different sub-fields of astronomy.. The citations have also been separated according to journal of origin.. As a result of this study, a quantitative estimate has been made of the titles and backruns that are required to satisfy a given percentage of the demand for astronomical research literature in the country..
938	Library Cost Analysis:  A Recipe	Unforgivably, time has passed since the days when the library's patron was the local monarch and cost was no deterrent.  Time's passage has replaced the monarch with taxpayers or stockholders, and, concurrently, sensitivity to cost has attained stellar importance.   The causes for being unaware of costs may stem from a variety of reasons, but they cannot, in all fairness to the profession, belie an inability to perform the simple arithmetic of cost accounting. What is suspected is a lack of the few simple ground rules and the logical operations that bind them together, in short - a recipe for cost accounting and analysis. In the following is outlined one such set of ground rules and their related procedural requirements, which have evolved and been applied with success over the past few years.  It is stressed that since this set represents the findings of one library, it may not fully satisfy the specific requirements of your own shop. Therefore, feel free to adopt the ground rules to your immediate requirements.  With regard to discipline, it is pretty much summed up in the six steps and five resource requirements which follow.  In addition to identifying steps, requirements, and the mysterious ways of cost analysis, these ingredients are blended together in a manner which will be meaningful for your internal operations and may be significant for your library's future.
982	Logical Flow Charts and Other New Techniques for the Administration of Libraries and Information Centers	The widespread introduction of electronic digital computer systems for information processing has produced significant advances in management theory and practice in recent years. For example, two management devices, PERT and CPM, undeveloped and impractical before computers, have been basic to the success of our outer space program.  It is perhaps overlate in library development, but appropriate in this memorial to Miss Esther J. Piercy, to explore the application of new management knowledge and practice to the administration of libraries and information centers, and to sketch some directions in which research could be undertaken to benefit the management of information.
130	Cooperation in Information Activities Through International Organizations	International cooperation in the processing, sharing, and transfer of scientific and technical information takes many forms and can be accomplished through many agencies.  This chapter proposes to review the role played by international organizations in stimulating and providing channels and mechanisms for such cooperation.  The international organizations to be discussed are of two types: intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), in which member nations participate through their governments under formal treaties or agreements; and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) where, with some exceptions, participation is through national professional societies or nongovernmental institutions.  The specialized agencies of the United Nations, including UNESCO, fall in the first category; organizations such as the International Federation for Documentation (FID) are in the second.
579	Functions of a Man-Machine Interactive Information Retrieval System	An effective man-machine interactive retrieval system is not achieved by simply placing a terminal on each end of an existing machine retrieval system.. An interactive system requires a sequence of steps in which man and machine alternately take action.. It should also provide different levels of services to experienced and inexperienced searchers, recognize the difference between a narrow and broad query, furnish clues as to the next direction to be searched, recognize the data base dynamically as the searcher changes his viewpoint, provide a ranking of responses in the most likely sequence and offer the searcher the option of overriding the ranking when a particular term is of extreme significance.. An online interactive system meeting many of these needs has been developed and tested.. The objectives of the development of this system, BROWSER, was to investigate the effectiveness of a free-form query with a combinatorial search algorithm and the effectiveness of various techniques and components to facilitate online browsing..
785	The Parametric Description of Retrieval Tests Part I: The Basic Parameters	Some parameters and techniques in use for describing the results of tests on IR systems are analysed.. Several considerations outside the score of the usual 2x2 table are relevant to the choice of parameters.. In particular, a variable which produces a 'performance curve' of a system corresponds to an extension of the 2x2 table.. Also, the statistical relationships between parameters are all-important.. It is considered that precision is not such a useful measure of performance (in conjunction with recall) as fallout.. A more powerful alternative to Cleverdon's 'inevitable inverse relationship between recall and precision' is proposed and justified, namely that the recall-fallout graph is convex..
712	Technical-Abstracting Fundamentals. II. Writing Principles and Practices	Abstracts can serve their purpose best only if they are carefully written to transmit important information to readers quickly and accurately.  This requires knowledge of audience needs, habits, and desires; ability to identify the key facts in the document; ability to organize these facts, to present them in the order best suited to the audience; and ability to write the abstracts clearly, concisely, and in conformity with the style rules of the medium involved.  Some of these abilities are inborn, but all can be learned by study, practice, and criticism.
857	Teaching with MARC Tapes	A computer based laboratory for library science students to use in class assignments and for independent projects has been developed and used for one year at Syracuse University.. MARC Pilot Project tapes formed the data base.. Different computer programs and various samples of the MARC file (48,000 records, approx.) were used for search and retrieval operations..  Data bases, programs, and seven different class assignments are described and evaluated for their impact on library education in general and individual students and faculty in particular..
588	Cardiovascular Serial Literature: Characteristics, Productive Journals, and Abstracting/Indexing Coverage	Two groups of journals were identified as potential sources for cardiovascular (c-v) information.. The first group consists of 78 c-v specialty journals, identified as cardiovascular from the title.. These 78 emanate from 24 countries, with about one-half of the specialty journals being published by 28 national and international societies.. The second group of journals is composed of those journals used by grantees of the National Heart Institute (NHI) to publish their findings.. In fiscal 1967, 5,860 papers, appearing in 789 journals, were reported to NHI.. Taking the grantees of NHI as being representative of U.S. c-v researchers, it was found that the specialty journals were not the most quantitatively fertile sources of c-v information - only about 14% of American c-v papers were published there.. The remaining 86% of the literature was widely dispersed throughout 766 nonspecialty c-v journals.. The extent of bibliographic control by the major indexing and abstracting services was found to be more extensive for the top-ranking journals in the NHI sample than for the group of c-v specialty journals..
64	A Computer-Based Serials Control System for a Large Biomedical Library	Rather than reiterate the obvious purposes and procedures involved in creating a computer system for control of serials, in this paper the author deals with the concept upon which the UCLA system is based and the manner in which the system is maintained in day-to-day operations of the UCLA Biomedical Library.. The paper deals with some of the points made in an earlier publication from the UCLA serials project.. The attempt is to show how the theory of publication pattern (discussed in the earlier article) has been used to produce a different idea in computer control of serials.. Publication pattern information which is entered into the master record for each title causes check-in cards for the next expected issue of each title to be generated by the computer, regardless of when this text issue is expected - next week, next month, next year.. This is departure from most systems, which attempt to predict a certain number of issues which should arrive during a given time period.. The information, which must be a part of the computer record, is described, as are library procedures in maintaining the system..
886	Automated Alternatives to Card Catalogs: The Current State of Planning and Implementation	The results of a study carried out under the auspices of the Council on Library Resources are described.. The stated goal of this study was to determine and analyze the current state of planning and implementation for computer-generated replacements for the card catalog (book catalog, microimage catalog, on-line catalog) for large collections (250,000 titles or more) and selected smaller libraries (less than 250,000 titles) that had actually implemented an alternative form of catalog..
801	UDC User Profiles as Developed for a Computer-Based SDI Service in the Iron and Steel Industry	Extension of the Selective Dissemination of Information system required the adoption of computer-based techniques.. The indexing language adopted is UDC and it was necessary to construct user profiles based on the classification.. Profiles have been compiled for individual clients of the service, for works within the British Steel Corporation, and for broad fields of activity within the iron and steel industry.. Use of the service has shown that UDC provides a satisfactory basis for profile compilation.. The majority of profiles so far constructed have relevance of over 95%, based on user assessment.. Possible future developments in the compilation of the profiles are considered..
810	A Probabilistic Search Strategy for MEDLARS	One technique for searching a Co-ordinate Index is to compare each reference with a Boolean expression of index terms.. This divides the file into retrieved and not-retrieved references.. An alternative is to assign each reference score calculated from its index terms and to retrieve the N highest scoring references in the file.. This scoring technique has several advantages in theory, and it performed slightly better in a retrieval test with N equal to the number of references retrieved by the corresponding Boolean search.. In the test a minimum value of N = 10 was used, and when less then this number of references matched the Boolean search requirement, the Scoring technique successfully widened the score of the search and retrieved twice as many relevant references as the Boolean searches..
821	Recent Growth of the Literature of Biochemistry and Changes in Ranking of Periodicals	The ideas and techniques of physics have been systematically applied to the study of living matter since the 1950s and 1960s.. As a result a rapid and large increase has taken place in the research activity in this field and biophysics and molecular biology have emerged as important areas of study.. The consequent enormous growth of literature  in the field has created great difficulties in tracking out the significant literature of the subject.. To cope with this unprecedented growth of literature, a ranking list of periodicals in this field has been prepared on the basis of citations in the Annual review of biochemistry for 1968, 1969, and 1970.. This list is expected to reflect the impact of literature on the progress of biochemical knowledge more accurately than the list prepared by Henkle in 1938.. The present list brings out the predominant position of biochemical research in the total scientific effort today, and the increasing bias of cognate disciplines towards biochemical methodologies.. A method of analysis of the number of citations in relation to size of the journal concerned and average length of the papers published has been developed and applied in this study.. The analysis yields three parameters which should be useful in assessing the actual scientific interest of a journal in relation to the number of paper published, compactness of the information content, and the scientific value of the paper in relation to compactness of presentation.. The results of the present study have been discussed in relation to Bradford's Law of Scattering and an extension of the Law has been suggested, namely, that during phases of rapid and vigorous growth of knowledge in a scientific disciplines, articles of interest to that discipline appear in increasing numbers in periodicals distant from that field.. It is expected that the present ranking list will enable librarians and other professional workers in the field of biochemistry to select journals from the viewpoint of their significance to the active areas or present day biochemical research..
1400	Systematic Analysis of University Libraries	As the administrators and librarians on every campus know, limited resources force hard choices among many desirable schemes for expanding and improving library facilities.  What percentage of new books should be acquired, how much service should be provided, how luxurious or austere should new library buildings be?
501	Compilation of Thesauri for Use in Computer Systems	A thesaurus can be defined as a structured vocabulary for use in information storage and retrieval systems. Three parts of this definition need further elaboration: 1. A vocabulary is a collection of terms. 2. The structure of a vocabulary can be described as a set of relationships between terms. 3. Utilization of a thesaurus in an information system involves a set of rules which take into account the characteristics of the system.
373	Some User Requirements Stated Quantitatively in Terms of the 90 Percent Library	Librarians, publishers, and information system engineers have very little verified information and few guidelines to describe the user's specific requirements for information.  Such information is needed to properly design or evaluate the information systems.  To date, most of the statements of requirements have been rather subjective, and often reflect opinion rather than actual fact.  Relatively little objective data have been obtained.  This is probably due in large part to the fact that there are extremely difficult methodological problems in trying to determine and state user requirements in a meaningful manner.  This paper suggests an approach or point of view that might help this situation by providing a method of phrasing the statements of user requirements in a more convenient and meaningful manner.  This paper also furnishes several examples of such statements, and discusses the techniques and data that support these statements. In this paper, attention is initially focused on the information requirements of workers in the field of science and technology, with no serious attempt made to include workers in other fields.  However, it seems quite likely that the approach, and perhaps even the stated principles, could be extended and generalized to cover other fields of knowledge.
890	Pattern Recognition and Structure-Activity Relationship Studies.. Computer-Assisted Prediction of Antitumor Activity in Structurally Diverse Drugs in an Experimental Mouse Brain Tumor System	This paper reports the application of pattern recognition and substructural analysis to the problem of predicting the antineoplastic activity of 24 test compounds in an experimental mouse brain tumor system based on 138 structurally diverse compounds tested in this tumor system.. The molecules were represented by three types of substructural fragments, the augmented atom, the heteropath, and the ring fragments.. Of the two pattern recognition methods used to predict the activity of the test compounds the nearest neighbor method predicted 83% correctly while the learning machine  method predicted 92% correctly.. The test structures and the important substructural fragments used in this study are given and the implications of these results are discussed..
145	ASIDIC Survey of Information Center Services	The data in that survey covered the year 1971.  Many recipients of the 1972 document have requested updated information.  Accordingly, the ASIDIC Cooperative Data Management Committee initiated a new survey. The questionnaires were mailed out in January of 1975 and responses came in throughout the year.  Questionnaires were sent to all member organizations of ASIDIC and EUSIDIC.  Questionnaires were also sent to individual members of ASIS SIG/SDI and SIG/UOI. Responses received throughout 1975 were checked and tabulated in 1976.  Because of the time delay in producing the final compilation the reader is warned against using this survey as an up-to-date source for information as to which centers are processing which data bases. Of the 116 responding organizations 75 process data bases and 41 use data base services either as end users or as brokers.  Of the 75 that process data bases (i.e., spin tapes) 51 (68%) are members of ASIDIC and/or EUSIDIC.  This survey provides representative data for data base processing organizations.  The use of online search services was relatively new in 1974 hence data regarding online users would not be representative of the 1976 online situation.
1144	Automatic Indexing	A state-of-the-art survey of automatic indexing systems and experiments has been conducted by the Research Information Center and Advisory Service on Information Processing, Information Technology Division, Institute for Applied Technology, National Bureau of Standards.  Consideration is first given to indexes compiled by or with the aid of machines, including citation indexes.  Automatic derivative indexing is exemplified by key-word-in-context (KWIC) and other word- in-context techniques.  Advantages, disadvantages, and possibilities for modification and improvement are discussed. Experiments in automatic assignment indexing are summarized. Related research efforts in such areas as automatic classification and categorization, computer use of thesauri, statistical association techniques, and linguistic data processing are described.  A major question is that of evaluation, particularly in view of evidence of human inter-indexer inconsistency.  It is concluded that indexes based on words extracted from text are practical for many purposes today, and that automatic assignment indexing and classification experiments show promise for future progress.
77	The Effectiveness of Automatically Generated Weights and Links in Mechanical Indexing	Work concerned with the statistical evaluation of the output of the MEDICO automatic indexing method is described.. The statistical test were designed primarily to examine the validity of the assumptions which formed the basis of the algorithms developed for the automatic computation of weights and for the automatic generation of links between index terms and modifiers.. This evaluation also includes a comparison of the output generated from full text and from the processing of the abstracts or summaries of the same articles..
957	An Economic Analysis of Library Benefits	Libraries find it increasingly necessary to use their limited resources in the most efficient manner.. This requires the use of decision rules which permit library resources to be directed to those activities which yield the highest returns.. An effort is made to utilize part of welfare economics to suggest which groups of library users will provide the greatest return to society.. An evaluation of the traditional library functions of education, information, and leisure suggests that libraries should direct their resources toward educational activities and not toward recreation when public monies are involved.. A case can be made for subsidizing the library activities of school-age children, other explicitly involved in education, disadvantages minority groups and governmental officials and staff.. Since public and school libraries produce and distribute essentially the same services, it is an uneconomic use of the communities' resources to maintain two separate institutions, one of which imposes costs on the other as children are forced to use public library facilities due to school library inadequacies..
479	Automatic Term Classifications and Retrieval	"Recent research at the Cambridge Language Research Unit has been concerned with the application of the automatic classification techniques associated with the ""theory of clumps"" to document description obtained from the Aslib-Cranfield project, and with the use of the resulting term classifications in retrieval.. A substantial program engine has been developed which computes similarities between pairs of terms on the basis of their occurrences and co-occurrences in document descriptions, and finds classes of terms with strong similarity connections by minimizing the cohesion between a potential clump and its complement; and which retrieves using single terms and/or term classes according to specification, and calculates recall and precision ratios for sets of requests.. Serious tests with different similarity and clump definitions and with different modes of using term classes are still in progress, so on definite conclusions about the value of this kind of classification are presented.."
720	A Selective Current-Awareness System Using Engineering Index's Plastics Data Base.  II. Performance	"The operational performance over a 17-month period of the previously described selective dissemination system is presented.  Of the 21,000 notifications sent to about 20 users, 91% were evaluated; of these, 14% were of ""Document-Ordered Interest,"" 48% were ""Of Interest,"" 27% were ""Marginal,"" and 11% were ""Of No Interest.""  Recall data obtained from about half the users over a period of eight months show the precision- factor/recall-factor products are generally greater than 0.5.  The effect of iterative profile adjustments on precision-recall performance is discussed.  A comparison made with four other SDI systems shows a relatively high level of performance for this system."
739	A Rapid Generalized Minicomputer Text Search System Incorporating Algebraic Entry of Boolean Strategies	This paper presents a rapid and efficient generalized minicomputer text searching system.. The system has been applied to Chemical Condensates and enjoys search speeds comparable to services operating on large computer systems.. Complete Boolean algebraic search strategy expressions may be used as direct entries, and all forms of transaction are automatically processed.. Benchmark search speeds and results are presented for realistic profiles serving varied research groups in a major university chemistry department..
853	A Fast Algorithm for Automatic Classification	An economical classification process of order n log n (for n elements), which does not employ n-square procedures.. Conversion proofs are given and possible information retrieval applications are discussed..
443	Quantitative Fuzzy Semantics	The point of departure in this paper is the definition of a language, L, as a fuzzy relation from a set of terms, T = {x}, to a universe of discourse, U = {y}.. As a fuzzy relation, L is characterized by its membership function mL:T*U -> [0,1], which associates with each ordered pair (x,y) its grade of membership, mL(x,y), in L.. Given a particular x in T, the membership function mL(x,y) defines a fuzzy set, M(x), in U whose membership function is given by mM(x)(y) = mL(X,y).. The fuzzy set M(x) is defined to be the meaning of the term x, with x playing the role of a name for M(x).. If a term x in T is a concatenation of other terms in T, that is, x = x1 ... xn, xi  T, i epsilon 1,...,n, then the meaning of x can be expressed in terms of the meanings of x1,...,xn through the use of a lambda-expression or by solving a system of equations in the membership functions of the xi which are deduced from the syntax tree of x.. The use of this approach is illustrated by examples..
223	Document Delivery Capabilities of Major Biomedical Libraries in 1968: Results of a National Survey Employing Standardized Tests	The standardized Document Delivery Tests (DDT's) developed earlier (Bulletin 56: 241-267, July 1968) were employed to assess the capability of ninety-two medical school libraries for meeting the document needs of biomedical researchers, and the capability of fifteen major resource libraries for filling I-L requests from biomedical libraries.. The primary test data are summarized as statistics on the observed availability status of the 300 plus documents in the test samples, and as measures expressing capability as a function of the mean time that would be required for users to obtain test sample documents.. A mathematical model is developed in which the virtual capability of a library, as seen by its users, equals the algebraic sum of the basic capability afforded by its holdings; the combined losses attributable to use of its collection, processing, relative inaccessibility, and housekeeping problems; and the gain realized by coupling with other resources (I-L borrowing).. For a particular library, or group of libraries, empirical values for each of these variables can be  calculated easily from the capability measures and the status statistics.. Regression equations are derived that provide useful predictions of basic capability from collection size.. The most important result of this work is that cost-effectiveness analyses can now be used as practical decision aids in managing a basic library service.. A program of periodic surveys and further development of DDT's is recommended as appropriate for the Medical Library Association..
1260	The Review of Scientific Instruments with Physics News and Views	A study of the periodicals for the subjects of physics and radio has been undertaken with the hope of indicating those which are most used in each field. The method selected is similar to that used by P.L.K. Gross and E.M. Gross.
1305	Copyright, Public Policy, and Information Technology	It is my purpose to single out two major information technologies that have already fostered considerable controversies - computer-based information storage and retrieval systems and photocopying technologies - and analyze the costs and benefits they have produced in various knowledge- sensitive circles of American society. I also suggest some immediate policy steps that might be taken concerning computers, photocopiers, and other information technologies.
863	RECON Pilot Project:  A Progress Report, April-September 1970	A synopsis of the third progress report on the RECON Pilot Project submitted by the Library of Congress to the Council on Library Resources.. An overview is given of the progress made from April through September 1970 in the following areas:  RECON production, format recognition, research titles, microfilming, and investigation of input devices.  In addition, the status of the tasks assigned to the RECON Working Task Force are briefly described..
595	Selected Results From An Inquiry Into Testing of Information Retrieval Systems	A variety of aspects related to testing of retrieval systems were examined.. A model of a retrieval system, together with a set of measures and a methodology for performance testing were developed.. In the main experiment the effect on performance of the following variables was tested:  sources of indexing, indexing languages, coding schemes, question analyses, search strategies and formats of output.. In addition, a series of separate experiments was carried out to investigate the problems of controls in experimentation with IR systems.. The main conclusions:  the human factor appears to be the main variable in all components of an IR system; length of indexes affects performance considerably more than indexing languages; question analyses and search strategies to affect performance to a great extent - as much, if not  more than indexing.. Retrieval systems seem to be able to perform at present only on a general level, failing to be at the same time comprehensive and specific.. It seems that testing of total IR systems controlling and monitoring all factors (environmental and systems-related) is not possible at present..
209	Survey of the Card Catalog in Medical Libraries	A survey of present uses and arrangement of medical library card catalogs was made in order to determine current practices and trends.. Attention was focused on the influences of MeSH on the card catalog.. The results indicate that the prevalent type of card catalog found in medical libraries is the divided catalog.. In addition, it appears that this catalog arrangement is gaining acceptance, and the trend is toward division.. MeSH has an effect on the organization of the card catalog; libraries indicate that it is an influential factor in the decision to divide the catalog..
881	Impact of National Developments on Library Technical Services and Public Services	Several recently established national programs are evaluated from the point of view of the practicing librarian.. It is essential that we be aware of the consequences of adopting these programs, and that planners and librarians communicate adequately..
1203	Patterns in the Use of books in Large Research Libraries	The accumulative growth, without limit in ultimate size, of the general research library must produce stresses and strains that many institutions will find difficult to resolve.  The rising costs of space for library buildings and bookstacks; the scarcity of centrally located campus land; aesthetic and functional limitations on the heights, bulk, and areas of library buildings; and increasing complexity in the organization of materials and services for the efficient use of large research collections, are illustrative of some of these stresses and strains.
702	The CA Integrated Subject File.  II. Evaluation of Alternative Data Base Organizations	The relative retrieval performances of the CA Integrated Subject File (CAISF), CA Condensates, and a Merged File created from these two data bases have been measured.  Retrieval performance is reported in terms of recall and precision values as well as costs.  The precision and recall retrieval failures - i.e., irrelevant documents and missed documents - have been analyzed for each data base and characterized according to the five major types of failures: index language, indexing, searching, clerical, and miscellaneous.  Over-all analysis of the performance suggests that an effective data base can be created by augmenting the CA Condensates data base with Registry Numbers and some representation of the CAISF General Subject concept headings, which results in a file approximately half the size of the corresponding CAISF data base and is suitable for search using existing retrieval system software.
3	Two Kinds of Power An Essay on Bibliographic Control	The relationships between the organization and control of writings and the organization and control of knowledge and information will inevitably enter our story, for writings contain, along with much else, a great deal of mankind's stock of knowledge and information.  Bibliographical control is a form of power, and if knowledge itself is a form of power, as the familiar slogan claims, bibliographical control is in a certain sense power over power, power to obtain the knowledge recorded in written form.  As writings are not simply, and not in any simple way, storehouses of knowledge, we cannot satisfactorily discuss bibliographical control as simply control over the knowledge and information contained in writings.
882	CONSER: An Update	The purposes of this paper are to explain what the CONSER Project is, to answer some of the questions that have been raised concerning it, and to make some general comments on the problems associated with this type of project.. This paper will not attempt to review in detail the history and operational facets of the project since these are available elsewhere..
563	A Study of Methods for Systematically Abbreviating English Words and Names	This study investigated various techniques for systematically abbreviating English words and names.. Most of the attention was given to the techniques which could be mechanized with a digital device such as a general purpose digital computer.. Particular was paid to techniques that could process incoming  information without prior knowledge of its existence (i.e., no table lookups).. Thirteen basic techniques and their modifications are described.. In addition, most of the techniques were tested on a sample of several thousand subject words and several thousand proper names in order to provide a quantitative measure of comparison..
1061	Milestones in Cataloging	"In the case of the present study, Dr.Lehnus was interested in applying a method - in a non-standard way for that method - to a type of literature that had not been addressed so far.  He proposed to begin with a single monograph on the subject ""cataloging,"" apply the method of citation analysis to the references of that work, and determine whether a core literature on cataloging could be discovered in this way.  There are innumerable examples of core literatures in scientific fields obtained from journal articles or through the Science citation index, but research via the monograph in non- scientific subjects has been minimal."
117	TOSAR - A Topological method for the Representation of Synthetic and Analytical Relations of Concepts	In mechanized systems used for searching in literature stores there is a steadily growing necessity not only to be able to formulate concepts as a search condition but also the characteristic connections under which these concepts appear in the inquiry.. In this way the precision of the mechanized literature search is considerably increased.. TOSAR has been developed in order to improve computerized literature searching in this respect..
1027	Linguistics and Information Science	This study was commissioned by the Committee on Linguistics in Documentation of the Federation Internationale de Documentation (FID). It is concerned with the linguistic aspects of information science, and in particular with the linguistic components of document analysis, description, and retrieval.  We have attempted to relate linguistics and information science by considering the theories and techniques linguistics has to offer, and how far these have been, or could be, exploited by information scientists.  We have examined these questions within the context of automated language processing and automated documentation.  The use of computers for linguistic operations presents special challenges as well as interesting possibilities, and we have chosen to approach the field from this particular point of view.
1359	Time and Motion Study of Library Operations	Application of standard work measurement techniques to acquisitions, cataloguing, and circulation functions of an aerospace library is described.  Sample of a representative production unit in included. A 38 per cent saving in manpower without loss of quality effort proves the library environment responds admirably to this management tool.
1010	The Science Citation Index: A New Concept in Indexing	"The purpose of this paper is to discuss citation indexing and its present application as exemplified by the Science Citation Index, published by the Institute for Scientific Information as a new, unique, and necessary tool for scientific work.  It is necessary, therefore, to describe briefly, and in general terms, the nature of conventional subject indexing systems in order that a basis for contrast between these and citation indexing can be obtained.  For those who wish to read extensively on the subject of indexing, references are provided at the end of the paper under the section ""Additional References."""
1032	Londoner and His Library	This report deals with a complementary theme: the public for which the public library service is provided.  It does this in two ways - by giving information about the nature of that public, as it is at present made up, and by reporting what people say about public libraries, not only those who are members, but also those who used to belong and those who never have.  Its closest relatives in British writing on this subject are, therefore, Mass Observation's now dated Reading in Tottenham (1947) and the Society of Young Publishers' Survey Books in London, 1959.  It is more comprehensive in scope and more detailed in its analysis that the Tottenham survey, while it goes in some depth into issues that necessarily played only a small part in Books in London.
378	Dialog Interactive Information Retrieval System	DIALOG is the name given to an interactive, computer-based information retrieval language developed at the Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory. The DIALOG systems consists of a series of computer programs which have been designed to make full use of direct access memory devices (in which data located anywhere on the device can be accessed in approximately the same amount of time) and video display units to provide the user a rapid and powerful means of identifying records within a file which satisfy the particular information need.  By providing the user full display access to the indexing vocabulary, and the ability to modify search expressions, DIALOG becomes a data processing extension of the human operator who directs and controls the process according to his own personal needs.
947	Library Networks	The combination of computers and communications technology is a development whose time has come for libraries in the U.S. And despite missteps and false starts inevitable in adapting the new technology for its use, libraries are now rapidly expanding telecommunications networks to serve their need to disseminate ever-expanding amounts of information in more effective ways. It makes a good deal of sense when one considers that the library's function is to parcel out information, and that information can be forwarded electronically as easily as it can be mailed. In fact, the logic of library networks is such that everyone is hopping on the bandwagon -- consultants, systems analysts, state agencies and a growing list of manufacturers that includes Xerox and International Business Machines.  Their initial efforts are concentrated on what are basically bookkeeping tasks -- in particular, the cataloging of new acquisitions.  The Ohio college Library Center, for example, provides its customers with entries for their card catalog files; and because OCLC is the first and most extensive of the networks, its approach is being closely copied by the others.
1348	Sociology and Modern system Theory	This book is intended as an exploratory sketch of a revolutionary scientific perspective and conceptual framework as it might be applied to the sociocultural system.  This point of view and still developing framework, as interpreted here, stems from the General Systems Research movement and the now closely allied fields of cybernetics and information or communication theory.  The principal goal of the book is to bring to the attention of a larger number of social scientists, particularly sociologists, the wealth of principles, ideas, and insights that have already brought a higher degree of scientific order and understanding to many areas of biology, psychology, and some physical sciences to say nothing of the applied areas of technology to which they are essential.
406	Guidelines for Library Automation; a Handbook for Federal and Other Libraries	This book is one of the products of a contract initiated by the Automation Task Force of the Federal Library Committee, sponsored and monitored by the U.S. Office of Education, and carried out by the System Development Corporation.  The project included a questionnaire survey of all Federal libraries (2104), as of December, 1970, to gather systems planning data and to identify Federal libraries with operational or planned automated systems. Respondents in the latter group were sent a Federal Library Automation Survey questionnaire requesting specific details about existing and planned systems. From these sources, amplified by visits to Federal libraries and an extensive review of the automation literature, information was distilled for use in this Handbook.
628	The Environment of Classification: The Concept of Mutual Exclusivity	It has been suggested that information science is still of the stage of alchemy:  if this is so then mutual exclusivity must form its philosopher's stone.. Mutual exclusivity appears to be alien to the observable universe:  that this is so is displayed through a series of examples.. Some of these relate to everyday things like trees, beaches and man himself,  whilst others relate to more obscure phenomena like continental drift and black holes.. The act of observation is also considered as this has a considerable bearing on the problem.. Nevertheless, mutual exclusivity must form part of man's mental powers and this has found expression in the relatively exclusive series of symbols used in communication.. The dangers of exclusive thinking in relation to environmental problems are considered, and this results in a paradox which is probably unresolvable.. Finally, it is observed that out-standing genius appears to pay scant regard to existing classifications and is more likely to be involved in an integrated approach to problems..
641	Representation of Concept Relations Using the TOSAR System of the IDC: Treatise III on Information Retrieval Theory	Successful information retrieval from a mechanized file is heavily dependent on the fidelity of the representation of concepts in the particular language of the system and on the predictability of this representation.. If an index language is employed, predictability is guaranteed and the quality of the retrieval is predominantly governed by the fidelity of the representation, i.e., by the extent to which conceptual distortion of the concepts to be represented can be avoided.. The various index languages vary widely with respect to their fidelity.. Differences in their performance are correspondingly great.. The lack of fidelity in most of the present day indexing languages is due mainly to insufficient representation of the relationships among concepts.. We describe a new graphical method of storing and retrieving concept relations of various kinds.. The points of such a graph are occupied by concepts, and the connecting lines between these points represent concept relations.. In a special field of chemistry, these graphs also serve as a kind of presentation of the essentials of a document to the reader that is much more lucid than a natural language text..
668	The Automatic Encoding of Chemical Structures	"Many methods for the coding of chemical structures have been described in the literature.	Some methods code the compound only partially; typical of these are the methods using descriptor codes.  Other methods, among which the so-called ciphers are prominent, code compounds exhaustively.  All these methods require cerebral effort; that is, a chemist is needed who must have learned the rules of the code, and who must known how to dismember correctly each structure to be coded.  A disadvantage of code designations of structures is, furthermore, that they are not generally understood by chemists.  No advantages accrue to the chemist from knowing how to generate and how to interpret a chemical code.	Codes are needed only for the mechanical manipulation of chemical structures.  Clearly then, if the coding of chemical compounds could be accomplished automatically this automatic conversion would relieve the chemist of considerable burden."
202	Medical Libraries and the Assessment of User Needs	Users of information in science and technology have been studied in great detail with respect to material read, amount of time spent in reading and searching the literature, categories of questions asked, an so on.. Probing for this information has been undertaken by means of structured  and unstructured  interviews, diaries, surveys, and questionnaires.. Although a large amount of data has emerged on information usage and flow, the subjective response of scientists furnishes comment only on the satisfaction produced by present information services and does not yield insight into the extent to which needs remain unsatisfied.. Relevance  figures based upon the response of systems to questions cannot be equated with satisfaction of needs, since questions constitute, in most cases, inadequate representations of underlying information needs.. Assessment of the needs of users of medical libraries and information system must, in fact, be made in relation to the observed behavior and experience of biomedical scientists.. There is room for well-designed experimentation which can explore the interaction of both psychological and environmental factors.. Significant differences in information needs exist among and between individuals such as researches and clinicians  in the same environment.. With respect to environment, it is hypothesized that the information needs for medical practitioners in remote areas might differ significantly from those of their colleagues working in large metropolitan centers in close proximity to medical schools, research institutions, and other rich sources of information fallout.. It is anticipated that experimentation will eventually result in a methodology which will permit the determination and prediction of the information needs of any identified groups of users in a specific environment..
1327	The SMART Retrieval System Experiments in Automatic Document Processing	The automatic SMART document retrieval system was designed at Harvard University between 1961 and 1964, and has been operating of IBM 7094 and 360 equipment both at Harvard and at Cornell University for several years.  The system takes documents and search requests in the natural language, performs a fully automatic content analysis of the texts using one of several dozen programmed language analysis methods, matches analyzed documents with analyzed search requests, and retrieves for the user's attention those stored items believed to be most similar to the submitted queries.
154	The UDC in its International Aspects	Universal Decimal Classification - dying duck or live bird? - or some such title - was suggested to me, but this is highly debatable, and there will hardly be time for the duck-shooters to develop a concerted onslaught in the half-hour or so allowed us for discussion.  Besides, I hope to be able to convince you - if the BSI's fine efforts have not already done so - that the UDC is by no means the dying duck - certainly not the dead duck - that some of its severest critics seem to imagine.  Perhaps the bird has ceased to soar as it once did in the times of Otlet, La Fontaine, Bradford and Donker Duyvis, but that it is still viable in the turbulent air of current documentation may be gauged from a recent FID inquiry aimed at obtaining figures for the distribution of UDC editions and an approximate estimate of the number of users throughout the world.
848	A Book Catalog at Stanford	Description of a system for the production of a book catalog for an undergraduate library, using an IBM 1401 Computer (12K storage, 4 tape drives), an expanded print chain on the 1403 Printer, and an 029 Card Punch for input.. Described are the conversion of cataloging information into machine readable form, the machine record produced, the computer programs employed, and printing of the catalog.. The catalog, issued annually, is in three parts: an author title catalog, a subject catalog, and a shelf list.. Cumulative supplements are issued quarterly.. A central idea in the depiction of entries in the catalog is the abandonment of the main entry concept.. The alphabetical arrangement of entries is discussed: sort keys employed, filing order observed, symbols employed to alter this order, and problems encountered.. Cost factors involved in the preparation of the catalog are summarized..
308	The Coming Crisis of Western Sociology	"The criticism and transformation of society can be divorced only at our peril from the criticism and transformation of theories about society.  Yet the gap between theory and practice, so common in the history of American radical movements, is in some quarters growing wider.  Some of the most militant of American radicals, in the New Left or in the movement for Black liberation, have at least temporarily avoided any serious concern with social theory. This neglect of theory doubtless has various origins.  In some part it is due to the fact that these social movements are still new and their political activism consumes their necessarily limited energies and resources; the new radicalisms will, in short, need time to produce their new theories.  Although the neglect of theory is scarcely peculiar to Americans, it is in part also due to the fact that American radicals are often more American than they know and may prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to the intangible outputs of theory.  Again, part of their neglect of theoretical problems is probably due to the close links that some young radicals have with the ""hippie"" contingent of their generation, whose more expressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting American culture dispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile ""hassles"" of intellectual confrontation.  There is also a vocal minority who, as has been said, feel personally excluded when they hear an appeal to reason."
1321	Scientists in Organizations Productive Climates for Research and Development	This book is addressed to scientists and engineers, to administrators of research and development, and to all others who are concerned about the effects of organizations upon the work of their members.  This book is one of the first major studies to examine the relationship between a scientist's performance and the organization of his laboratory.  Unlike many previous expositions about the best environment for technical people, the findings resulted from extensive analysis of factual data from a wide range of research personnel. Work progressed over the next four years, and a number of intriguing results began to emerge.  But as these were discussed with other investigators studying different kinds of R & D laboratories, discrepancies appeared.  It became clear that a broader study was needed before one could be sure what constitutes a stimulating environment for research personnel.  We set out to design a study in which standardized instruments would be administered to scientists and engineers in several types of laboratories.
267	System Analysis in University Libraries	A comprehensive enginnering approach to the analysis and functional design of library systems is described in terms of fundamental space-time relationship which characterize university libraries.. Long-run trends in aquisitions and circulation are related to the relative obsolescence of stored materials, and the uncertainty of short-run demand pattern is related to the need for excess service capability.. The spatial dispertion of library resources among specialized information centers and central depositories is considered with respect to availability, retrieval, duplication, and efficient storage..
129	Generation and Uses of Machine-Readable Data Bases	This chapter continues the coverage of the generation and use of machine-readable data bases inaugurated in Volume 9 by Williams (178).  It is therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is prepared in general accordance with Williams's initial compilation. The same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applications used in Volume 9 are continued this year.  A data base is considered to be an organized collection of machine-readable records containing bibliographic and/or document-related data (e.g., index information). The data bases that we will consider are used for information storage and retrieval and/or research in information storage and retrieval or data base generation. The choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas.  First, data bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographic information, such as chemical structures, (Milen et al., 112) are excluded. Thus, even though the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number is a data element common to many bibliographic data bases, papers such as that by CAS regarding progress in building the Registry System itself (39) are excluded.  Similarly, though some textual and bibliographic material is included in the Systems Consultants, Inc report (156) to the Navy, most of the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in a shipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of this chapter.  Finally, though many of the data bases are used for generation of publications via phototypesetting, we are not considering that production operation.
1420	Time-Lag in Cataloging	Any who have the arduous task of assisting a student through that ultimate of academic exercises, the preparation and defense of a dissertation, are likely to define happiness as a good book written by an advisee.  This book is a cause of joy.  The author expended much more effort than is usually the case to gain even the smallest detail, because the subject matter is strangely intractable, hedged round with perplexities and not a few vested interests.  Letters and reports get locked away where they may not be seen except by the most persistent investigator and one who somehow meets criteria that no one else can claim.  In the end, the author deserves the praise and the advisor is well rewarded with the inner satisfaction that comes from participation in an important investigation finished as an influential and well-written book.
352	Developing Multi-Media Libraries	This book presents the concept of the modern library as a comprehensive resource center.  The philosophy and objectives of the center are clarified, and desirable practices in the selection and acquisition of nonbook or audiovisual materials - interchangeably defined as those materials that communicate primarily through aural and visual stimuli - are recommended, along with information pertinent to facilitating these tasks.  Their organization in general in discussed, with emphasis on the necessity for basic decisions and policies.  Cataloging and physical processing are treated in particular, demonstrating that accepted library practices can be flexible enough to allow adaptation for both the individual library and its specific clientele.  Realistic methods of handling the many different kinds of nonbook materials are demonstrated by treating each type separately.  Many easy-to- follow cataloging examples are presented; and, consistent with established library routine, practical information is provided on selection, acquisition, physical processing, storage, and equipment.  Work-flow charts are included to present a graphic demonstration of efficient procedures.
1438	An Unhurried View of Copyright	Copyright protection became necessary with the invention of the printing press and had its early beginnings in the British censorship laws.  The fortunes of the law of copyright have always been closely connected with freedom of expression, on the one hand, and with technological improvements in means of dissemination, on the other.  Successive ages have drawn different balances among the interest of the writer in the control and exploitation of his intellectual property, the related interest of the publisher, and the competing interest of society in the untrammeled dissemination of ideas.  It is this striking of balances in the law of copyright in the past, at present, and for the future, which constitutes the central theme of the James Carpentier Lectures delivered by Professor Benjamin Kaplan at the Columbia University School of Law in March, 1966.
1196	Retrieval of Bibliographic Entries from a Name-Title Catalog by Use of Truncated Search Keys	An experiment to produce information on the utility of co-ordinating derived, truncated search keys as enquiry terms to an on-line bibliographic system was performed on a file of 132,808 name-title entries.. Statistics on the number of entries associated with each key for keys varying from four to eight characters in length were obtained.. Assuming use of a keyboard cathode ray tube terminal capable of displaying at least ten lines of text, and taking spelling error probabilities into account, a derived key consisting of the first three characters of author name concatenate with the first three characters of title was determined to be effective for at least four-fifths of all academic libraries..
1029	A Little Commonwealth Family Life in Plymouth Colony	The kind of study presented in this monograph has not as yet won a wide following among working historians.  On the whole their interest has remained with the larger units of social action: the region, the class, the party, the ethnic or religious group.  It has been left to the so-called behavioral sciences - anthropology, sociology, psychology - to demonstrate the fundamental importance of the smallest and most intimate of all group environments, the family.
1308	Science:  Growth and Change	More and more examples accumulated of highly variable growth rates and of their influence on scientific careers.  Gradually the study began to incorporate calculations of the effects of variable growth on a wide range of scientific concerns: studying, teaching, research, publishing, citations, the basis of scientific prestige, promotions, unemployment.  It became apparent that generally unsuspected forces have a powerful influence on the careers of scientists and everyone else enmeshed in rapid change. This book presents some evidence for change and speculates about many effects.  It also makes a beginning toward understanding the forces that cause and do not cause change.  It may provide some solace for those in dormant fields who have wondered why life has passed them by.  It may, perhaps, make a few highly successful scientists a little more modest.  Most of all it may guide those who still have a choice - and so have we all.
41	New Factors in the Evaluation of Scientific Literature Through Citation Indexing	More than one million citations from the scientific literature have been processed by the Citation Index Project at the Institute for Scientific Information.. The Project, sponsored by NSF and NIH, will be described briefly, and new methods of using citation data for evaluation of publications will be discussed.. Summaries of statistical data, compiled by computer methods such as the following, will be given.. 1. Frequency of citation of one journal by another.. 2. Frequency of current citations to the past literature.. 3. Frequency of self-citation by journals and authors.. 4. Number of source citations per cited paper.. 5. Number of references per source paper.. 6. Number of papers published per journal..
996	International Developments in Cataloging	The IFLA Committee on Cataloging has been at work since 1954 to establish international standards for cataloging and bibliographic records; it was responsible for the International Conference on Cataloging Principles, Paris, 1961, and and the International Meeting of Cataloging Experts, Copenhagen, 1969.. In recent years there have been increasing demands from national cataloging bodies and bibliographic agencies for uniformity in codes and practices, and in consequence there has been more willingness to make national concessions in order to reach international standards.. The IFLA Cataloging Secretariat was established in 1971 to assist this trend by co-ordinating work, promoting new projects and acting as a liaison center..
153	Criteria for Evaluating Technical Library Effectiveness	In July 1966 John I. Thompson & Company accepted a contract with the Picatinny Arsenal, US Department of the Army, to perform a study aimed at developing 'Criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of library operations and services' under the ATLIS Program (Army Technical Library Improvement Studies).  The study was divided into three phases aimed at: I A Literature search to reflect the current 'state-of-the art' covering library standards and the methods of evaluating libraries developed up to the present. II A phase in which to gather and evaluate any data required from Army Technical Libraries, from available surveys already published, or from any other sources, by which to develop criteria. III A phase in which to establish and validate the criteria. Phases I and II of the study are now complete.  Phase III is in progress and is expected to be completed by the late fall of 1968.  The reports of Phases I and II are already available for detailed study and that of Phase III will be available soon.  The purpose of this paper is to present some of the findings of the study.
660	On Relevance, Probabilistic Indexing and Information Retrieval	"This paper reports on a novel technique for literature indexing and searching in a mechanized library system.. The notion of relevance is taken as the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparative concept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability.. The resulting technique called ""Probabilistic Indexing,"" allows a computing machine, given a request for information, to make a statistical inference and derive a number (called the ""relevance number"") for each document, which is a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given request ranked according to their probable relevance.. The paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional library system the cross-referencing (""see"" and ""see also"") is based solely on the ""semantical closeness"" between index terms, statistical measures of closeness between index terms can be defined and computed.. Thus, given an arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machine can elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevant documents that would not otherwise have been selected.. Finally, the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole library problem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis of which the library system makes a concatenated statistical inference in order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documents which most probably satisfy the information needs of the user.."
530	Indexing Language Structure for Automated Retrieval	"A proposal for a computer-aided method of building up an indexing language is made.. The method involves linking the terms relevant to any special retrieval system into the UDC, preferably in the form of the Standard Reference Code when it becomes available.. Links between the terms are intended to be established in such a way that, provided indexing input sessions are accomplished via a video terminal, a hybrid thesaurus-classification could be built up by a form of ""learning process"" in the course of regular indexing.. The proposed means of establishing links between terms are described, the associated computer system is outlined, and an example of indexing language built-up procedure is presented.. Possible uses for natural language search, using the thesaurus-classification as a ""switching language"", and for automatic classification, are suggested as long-term aims.."
998	The Other Half of Cataloging	The authors investigate the impact of a bibliographic retrieval/card production system, such as the Ohio College Library Center (OCLC), with special attention to its role in cataloging.. Activities required at the local level to make the LC card a functioning component of the catalog are described.. The characteristics of the ensuring workload are examined, along with methods of accomplishing it.. These activities are seen as a factor in the persistence of backlogs.. The design of OCLC, because of the immobility of the terminal and the absence of the catalog from the data base, by-passes this workload, leaving the local library to accomplish it by the method of its choice, as before, or to leave it undone..
1309	Science and Information Theory	A new scientific theory has been born during the last few years, the theory of information.  It immediately attracted a great deal of interest and has expanded very rapidly.  This new theory was initially the result of a very practical and utilitarian discussion of certain basic problems:  How is it possible to define the quantity of information contained in a message or telegram to be transmitted?  How does one measure the amount of information communicated by a system of telegraphic signals?  How does one compare these two qualities and discuss the efficiency for coding devices?  All of these problems, and many similar ones, are of concern to the telecommunication engineer and can now be discussed quantitatively. From these discussions there emerged a new theory of both mathematical and practical character.  This theory is based on probability considerations. Once stated in a precise way, it can be used for many fundamental scientific discussions.  It enables one to solve the problem of Maxwell's demon and to show a very direct connection between information and entropy.  The thermodynamic entropy measures the lack of information about a certain physical system.  Whenever an experiment is performed in the laboratory, it is paid for by an increase of entropy, and a generalized Carnot Principle states that the price paid in increase of entropy must always be larger than the amount of information gained.  Information corresponds to negative entropy, a quantity for which the author coined the word negentropy.  The generalized Carnot Principle may also be called the negentropy principle of information.  This principle imposes a new limitation on physical experiments and is independent of the well-known uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics.
1182	The Bibliography of Operational Research	In his book on Documentation (1948) the librarian, S.C. Bradford, discussed certain regularities in the pattern of distribution of articles on a particular subject over different journals.  He gives as examples the distributions for geophysics from 1928-31 inclusive and lubrication for 1931 to June, 1933, inclusive.  The typical picture is one in which, to a bibliography covering a certain short term of years, a few journals contribute a large number of articles, more journals contribute fewer and so on in a monotonic sequence ending with a large number of journals contributing one article each.  Patterns of this kind have been observed by several authors, but Bradford was the first, I think, to advance an explanation of the effect in bibliographical terms.
178	The Automation Survey: Background and Conclusions	During the past decade the Library of Congress, in common with many other research libraries, has become increasingly aware of pressures and strains in many of its operations.  These areas of concern (well known to librarians) include mounting arrearages in cataloguing and other processing activities; increasing complexity of manual inventory control files; increasing difficulty in keeping card catalogues reasonably current and accurate; and increasing demands for a wide variety of services for a clientele whose needs for information have grown tremendously since World War II, and many of whom have only recently turned to large research libraries for help.  Five years ago an internal committee of the Library of Congress was charged to study potential applications of electronic data processing equipment to Library procedures; subsequently representatives of three computer firms made brief studies of Library operations which intimated that certain areas could benefit substantially by automation.
192	A Cooperative Serial Acquisition Program: Thoughts on a Response to Mounting Fiscal Pressures	A regionally cooperative method of distributing responsibility for every serial title in a region is outlined.. The system assures the equitable distribution of the number of titles for which each library is committed.. Later refinements suggest an equalization of cost commitments on the basis of fiscal resources available for serial purchases.. It is pointed out that fiscal realities will force some sort of serial acquisition cooperation for all viable medical libraries..
377	Citation Indexes	Citation indexing is a relatively new method of organizing the contents of a collection of documents in a way that overcomes many of the shortcomings of the more traditional indexing methods.  The primary advantage of citation indexing is that it identifies relationships between documents that are often overlooked in a subject index.  An important secondary advantage is that the compilation of citation indexes is especially well suited to the use of man-machine indexing methods that do not require indexers who are subject specialists.  Furthermore, citations, which are bibliographic descriptions of documents, are not vulnerable to scientific and technological obsolescence as are the terms used in subject indexes.
124	The User Interface in Interactive Systems	The digital computer has been used as a problem-solving tool for only two decades.  During most of this time, computer scientists have concentrated on learning how to build the tool: applying electronic technology, arranging for data flow between components, and manufacturing the hardware.  Now we are entering a new stage in which computing power is made available through interactive terminals to people who are not computer scientists.  This is possible on a large scale only because design and marketing innovators now have confidence in their ability to provide reliable, cost-effective service to less sophisticated users.  In this new stage, the natural behavior patterns of users become an important element in the design of the interface to the tool.
482	Some Experiments in the Selective Dissemination of Information in the Field of Plasma Physics	A small-scale, computer-based SDI system in plasma physics and the related subjects is described briefly.. The system serves about 100 research scientists and engineers and uses title input only in order to minimize input costs.. The implications of this approach and its effect upon the system parameters is discussed.. Some comparison of the costs of the computer-based system with those of a manual system is made.. Further experiments are described in which the service is expanded to external users on a world-wide basis, the aim being to compare, under controlled conditions, the parameters of the small-scale internal service with those of an external service on a wide scale.. The paper concludes with some observations on the future development and organization of computer-assisted services, their possibilities and the main problems which are likely to arise..
254	Chemical Information Systems	The purpose of a chemical information system must not be restricted to the storage and retrieval of facts.  It is equally important that the system shall provide methods which enable a scientist to assemble and to correlate the facts.  Chemical information systems are required primarily as a service to research chemists to enable them to keep up to date with current developments in their fields of interest, and the establishment of information services has relieved the chemist of many of his problems of literature searching and information storage and organization.
826	User Evaluation of Information Retrieval Systems	While Fairthorne may not have been the first person to recognize it, certainly, for this author, Fairthorne was the first to make explicit the fundamental problems of information retrieval systems, namely the clash between OBNA and ABNO (Only-But-Not-All and All-But-Not-Only). Although it was not until 1958 that the terms occur in Fairthorne's writings, the concept had been discussed in many meetings of the AGARD Documentation Panel and elsewhere.  Originally it was considered that to meet these two requirements, it might be necessary to have two separate systems, and the test of the UNITERM system in 1954 was based on the hypothesis that a 'Marshalling' system (e.g. U.D.C.) was fundamentally different from a 'Retrieval' system (e.g. UNITERM).  While the idea persisted in this form for some time, it gradually evolved into the inverse relationship of recall and precision, which is to say that while it is possible to obtain, of the relevant documents, All-But-Not-Only, or alternatively to obtain Only-But- Not-All, it is not possible to obtain All and Only.
1233	A Theory of Human Motivation	The present paper is an attempt to formulate a positive theory of motivation which will satisfy these theoretical demands and at the same time conform to the known facts, clinical and observational as well as experimental.  It derives most directly, however, from clinical experience. This theory is, I think, in the functionalist tradition of James and Dewey, and is fused with the holism of Wertheimer, Goldstein, and Gestalt Psychology, and with the dynamicism of Freud and Adler.  This fusion of synthesis may arbitrarily be called a 'general-dynamic' theory.
397	Formal Languages and Their Relation to Automata	This book presents the theory of formal languages as a coherent theory and makes explicit its relationship to automata.  The book begins with an explanation of the notion of a finite description of a language.  The fundamental descriptive device - the grammar - is explained, as well as its three major subclasses - regular, context-free, and context-sensitive grammars.  The context-free grammars are treated in detail, and such topics as normal forms, derivation trees, and ambiguity are covered.  Four types of automata equivalent to the four types of grammars are described.  These automata are the finite automaton, the pushdown automaton, the linear bounded automaton, and the Turing machine.  The Turing machine is covered in detail, and unsolvability of the halting problem shown.  The book concludes with certain advanced topics in language theory - closure properties, computational complexity, deterministic pushdown automata, LR(k) grammars, stack automata, and decidability.
1136	Data Retrieval Systems:  Specifics and Problems	"The essential differences between data retrieval system and document retrieval systems are considered.. The notion of ""fact"" is discussed, analyzing the influence of the definition adopted on the structure of a data retrieval system.. A proposition is advanced that a factographic JRS is a rudimentary but indispensable form on the way to a logical information system.. The latter type of system by a capability for automatic analysis of input data and synthesis of new information.. The problem of the information retrieval language for data retrieval system is discussed, as is its machine organization, intricately tied up with the specifics and functions of a system of that kind.."
1234	Multidimensional Scaling by Optimizing Goodness of Fit to a Nonmetric Hypothesis	Multidimensional scaling is the problem of representing n objects geometrically by n points, so that the interpoint distances correspond in some sense to experimental dissimilarities between objects.. In just what sense distances and dissimilarities should correspond has been left rather vague in most approaches, thus leaving these approaches logically incomplete.. Our fundamental hypothesis is that dissimilarities and distances are monotonically related.. We define a quantitative, intuitively satisfying measure of goodness of fit to this hypothesis.. Our technique of multidimensional scaling is to compute that configuration of points which optimizes the goodness of fit.. A practical computer program for doing the calculations is described in a companion paper..
1073	Automatic Construction of Thesauri and of Concept Systems for Dictionaries and Subject Lists	"After a synopsis of the relations existing between descriptors and their concepts, the EPD-program called ""GENTHES"" is described.  The program supports the construction of a thesaurus and its use.  The relational system corresponds to ISO/DIS 2788 (UNESCO) and DIN 1463.  It differentiates, however, in addition generically related and contiguous terms pertaining to a part-whole system. Characteristics that determine narrower terms against their broader terms are introduced as new relation.  Many types of associations are made available for experimenting.  The programmed generation of dependent relations reduces the amount of work to one third although ensuring total avoidance of formal errors and logical contradictions, even in applying permitted polyhierarchy.  The program is available in batch mode or in an interactive timesharing version (Remote GENTHES).  The program functions are input, logical and formal input checking, generation of relations, display, delete, print on line printer and storage on disk.  GENTHES is running in Vienna on a System IBM/370."
587	Obsolescence of Special Library Periodicals: Sampling Errors and Utility Contours	"Problems arising in the measurement of the rates of obsolescence of the sets of periodicals taken by special libraries are discussed.. The relatively large errors that arise in sampling the negative exponential distribution are analyzed because they may account for some of the discrepancies reported and because they indicate the need for firmer statistical control of work on obsolescence than has yet been generally appreciated.. When the rate of decline has been satisfactorily established there still remains the problem of deciding how to apply it.. Issues of those periodicals that contribute most productively should be retained for a longer period than those of periodicals that contribute less.. To solve this problem the concept of ""utility contours"" is introduced and exemplified in the design of a p% library.. It is argued that no discarding policy is likely to be generally applicable; every special library must be regarded as a special case.  Rather than suggest new measurements, therefore, the paper offers simple graphical techniques that are applicable to any other special case.."
1396	Survey of Commercially Available Computer-Readable Bibliographic Data Bases	This document contains the results of a survey of 94 US organizations, and 36 organizations in other countries that were thought to prepare machine-readable data bases.. Of those surveyed, 55 organizations (40 in U.S., 15 in other countries) provided completed camera-ready forms describing bibliographic information about published literature.. The following types of data were requested for each data base:  Name, frequency of issue, and time span covered by the data base; Name of organizations and individuals who can provide information on the data base; Subject matter and scope of data on the tape; Source of information in the data base (journal articles, reports, patents, monographs, etc.); Method(s) used for indexing or other types of subject analysis; Special data elements; Tape specifications (density, tracks, labels, etc.); Availability of programs for retrospective searching and selective dissemination of information (SDI); Type and cost of search services offered; and Availability and charges for data bases.. The information provided represents the status of these data bases as of November 1972.. It is anticipated that libraries and other information centers will find this document helpful in selecting data bases for providing SDI; retrospective search services, and other bibliographic reference services to their users..
626	The User Interface for Interactive Bibliographic Searching: An Analysis of the Attitudes of Nineteen Information Scientists	Since little substantiated evidence exists concerning the features that should of should not be included in the man-machine interface of interactive bibliographic search and retrieval (IBSR) systems, an informal survey tapping the opinions of scientists active in this research area was conducted.. An analysis of the responses showed a significant level of agreement concerning interface features..
1129	Creating an Information Language on the Basis of Semantic Text Analysis	Discusses the possibility of setting up an IL with a development grammar and logic, capable of solving problems of diverse informational complexity (documentary search, data search, automatic text, condensation, automatic translation).. The semantic language EKHO is proposed as a language of this kind.. Its structure is described, and its potentialities for information are followed.
274	Question-Negotiation and Information Seeking in Libraries	"Seekers of information in libraries either go through a librarian intermediary or they help themselves.. When they go through librarians they must develop their questions through four levels of need, referred to here as the visceral, conscious, formalized, and compromised needs.. In this pre-search interview with an information-seeker the reference librarian attempts to help him arrive at an understanding od his ""compromised"" need by determining: (1) the subject of his interest; (2) his motivation; (3) his personal characteristics; (4) the relationship of the inquiry to file organization; and (5) anticipated answers.. The author contends that research is needed into the techniques of conducting this negotiation between the user and the reference librarian.."
624	Clinician Search for Information	The use of a medical library by members of the faculty of a medical school was studied by questionnaire in an effort to ascertain the part the library played, among channels of communication, in work-related information searches.. The study described the population of users and the kinds of sources they utilized in an information search, in an effort to identify the factors influencing their choice of kinds of sources and leading to the possibility of predicting use of kinds of source once the characteristics of the users were known.. It brought out a high use of sources which are accessible and easy to use.. The tabulations show the importance of co-workers in informal communication.. Low delegation of documentation tasks to libraries was apparent.. The main user of the library studied was a clinician in the area of internal medicine who used journal articles about diseases for information to use in the treatment of his patients.. The recommendations were made that journals should be shelved accessibly, with Index Medicus nearby.. Books might be shelved less accessibly.. Telephone access to the library is of major importance as is the provision of adequate photocopying facilities..
1269	Scholarly Reprint Publishing in the United States	With this book I try to offer readers a broad picture of the current reprint industry, as well as an account detailed enough to capture the fast-moving reprint scene from various viewpoints.
387	The Foundations of Education for Librarianship	The study is a result of a theory of librarianship which has been in the process of maturation for more than a quarter century of teaching and administration, first at the University of Chicago, and subsequently at Western Reserve University, now Case Western Reserve University, and which has been elaborated in essays and addresses as the inquiry progressed. My purpose has been to explore the role of the library as it contributes to the total communication system in society and the meaning of that role for the library profession, and having determined the requirements of that role to identify those which are appropriately met by graduate professional education.  Therefore, the inquiry begins with a consideration of the communication system within the individual as related to his physiological, neurological, and psychological structure, and its meaning for learning and reading patterns and characteristics.  The study then progresses to an exposition of the cultural environment and its communication system in society, together with the place of the library in it.
974	Cost Survey: Cost of Ordering, Cataloging, and Preparations in Southern California Libraries	It was our original intention to include the cost of book selection with the cost of ordering, as part of the total acquisition process.  We also attempted to get indirect costs, such as rent and utilities.  Very few of the libraries were able to supply these figures so we based our survey on direct cost only.  We found from the preliminary survey that book selection statistics were extremely difficult to determine, since all the professional staff in the libraries concerned participated in book selection, with the chief librarian performing most of it.  As a result, the cost of book selection was exceedingly high and threw the cost of ordering out of proportion.
858	The RECON Pilot Project: A Progress Report	A synthesis of the progress report submitted by the Library of Congress to the Council on Library Resources under an Officer's Grant to initiate the RECON Pilot Project that gives an overview of the project and the progress made from August-November 1969 in the following areas: training, selection of material to be converted, investigation of input devices, and format recognition..
1050	Medical Innovation: a diffusion study	The research reported here constitutes a case study in the acceptance of an innovation.  The innovation is a medical one, a drug which physicians use in everyday practice; the setting is in the Midwestern United States in the 1950's.  This study gives a glimpse of one small part of the great changes that have recently occurred within medicine and thus is of specific interest to the medical profession and its allied institutions. But more generally, the question of the spread of an innovation is of interest to all students of society.  Particularly in an age of change, and in our complex and massive society, an understanding of the way in which an innovation can spread - for better or worse! - constitutes important knowledge of man.  It is to aid in this understanding, as well as to describe the case at hand, that this report is written.
402	The government of the American Public Library	"The major purpose of this study is to describe, analyze, and evaluate the position of the public library in the structure of government in the United States.  The use of the word ""government"" in the title, therefore, is deliberate.  We are here concerned with the legal forms and types of governmental organization of the public library and with its relation to the city or other political unit to which it is attached or which it serves."
560	Indivisible Colleges; Diffusion of Knowledge in Scientific Communities	In the last two decades, dramatic increases in the scope and volume of scientific research have occurred, as may be illustrated by the fact that the amount of scientific literature is doubling approximately every ten years (Price 1963).  For the scientist who needs to locate particular items of scientific information and for the documentation specialist who must make them readily available, the organization and management of this huge and expanding store of information is a serious problem.  Increasingly radical solutions are being proposed.  For example, some experts would like to scrap scientific journals and distribute their contents piecemeal. Information retrieval and delivery systems are being developed to enable scientists to locate information quickly and effectively.
1377	On-Line Reference Retrieval in a Public Library	"There are many useful computer-readable data bases that are accessible only to major governmental units, universities, or industrial organizations. An experiment is described in which the public library is used as a ""linking agent"" between the public and such data bases. Retrieval terminals have been placed  in four public libraries in Northern California to provide access to sixteen different data bases.  The first year of this two-year experiment is described, and some of the technical, organizational, and economic aspects of the study are reviewed. Rapid acceptance of the system during this initial no-cost period has been achieved and  useful evaluative data have been obtained."
1217	Prestige, Class and Mobility	This volume contains the report of a sample survey conducted in Denmark 1953-1954.  In addition the author has attempted to integrate survey findings with relevant sociological theory and with previous research findings.
1170	Some Aspects of Subject Acquisition and Detailed Subject Retrieval of Patent Information	Aspects of subject acquisition and retrieval of patent information are discussed.. A patent-information service system is conventionally separated into two parts:  a subject acquisitions system designed for stock acquisition and search file building, and a detailed subject retrieval system designed to deal with specific user requests.. The performance of both systems is analyzed using patent classifications as examples.. The tasks of classification research in relation to subject acquisitions system requirements are formulated..
540	Information:  Methodology	This book sheds light on basic problems, principles and results of philosophical-methodological research in information concepts, gives critical analysis of its idealistic interpretation. Author proves possibility more general definition of information using categories of reflectivity and inequality. Both mathematical variants (statistical-probability and nonstatistical) as well as semantic concepts of information are analyzed, basic information species and functions in human society are determined.
125	Machine-Readable Bibliographic Data Bases	"The advent of machine-readable data bases is one of the most significant forward steps in information retrieval.. Currently, the creation and application of these data bases are in a period of very rapid growth.. This reviewer sees a great need for a review of ""what is going on"" because there is so much going on.. It is the goal of this chapter to fulfill that need even though it is difficult to hold this dynamic field static for a good meaningful look.."
620	On-Line Serials Control System on a Large Biomedical Library Part II. Evaluation of Retrieval Features	The on-line serials control system in use at UCLA Biomedical Library utilizes an inverted file for its primary technique.. The correct title is reached with a entry about 80% of the time by using average of three title words.. A detailed profile of title structure and search scheme is given.. The major determinants of the scheme are evaluated on a performance and cost basis..
726	Evaluation of the Database CA Condensates Compared with Chemical Titles	"The performance of CA Condensates and Chemical Titles based on analysis of precision and ""relative recall CT/CC"" for a collection of 46 search profiles was studied over a period of one year.. Special emphasis was laid on the function of the keyword phrases of CC and the users' attitude towards literature categories not represented in CT.. The results are discussed in terms of the value of the systems for Danish users seen from users' and the documentalist's point of view.."
286	User's Reaction to Microfiche A Preliminary Study	Recent emphasis placed on the use of microfiche  by large government agencies has increased the pressure in libraries supporting government research to make greater use of microfiche.. Negative and apathetic user attitudes, expressed by researchers, indicate that expanded efforts to overcome resistance if the great potential of microfiche is to be realized.. Efforts in microphotography, expended on technical achievement in the past, should be directed toward understanding the user and his needs to discover why he avoids microforms and how to overcome his resistance to them..
1328	Developments in Data Analysis	The last ten years have witnessed rapid and often radical changes in computer programming systems for social science data.  At least a dozen different program packages, collections, or systems (not to mention hundreds of individual programs) have emerged by now and are in use by social scientists at universities and research centers all across the country.  It is probably safe to say that the bulk of these systems and programs represent the individual efforts of a small group working at one institution, often operating under a relatively restricted set of research and computing assumptions.  This parochial tendency has left students and researchers with the often bewildering and always time- consuming problem of learning new procedures for processing their data each time they change institutions (or each time the institution changes computers).
1115	Informational Reviews in the Age of Information Crisis	A critical analysis is given of existing classification schemes for reviews.  The author proposes to distinguish between two main review types: orienting and informative ones.  The importance is stressed of informative (analytical and abstracting) reviews, which contain new information under the conditions of information crisis being interpreted as overproduction of documents rather than new knowledge.
1382	Statistics and Semantics	This monograph is one of the few works in which the possibility of studying semantics using statistical methods is proven with actual research. The semantic field of words denoting color (in English, French, Russian and Ukranian) was chosen as a representative semantic object. The applied aspects of this work are particularly important: the application of those methods tested by the authors for solving problems of automatic information processing, as well as in language translation and instruction.
960	Library Operations Research: A Process of Discovery and Justification	This article begins with a discussion of the broad role of operations research (O.R.) in a society undergoing change.. The nature of O.R. terms in a library environment is then considered.. The function of models in O.R. is analyzed, the development of a model being contrasted with its formal presentation.. Criteria for good models are suggested.. This article then focuses on storage models for libraries, first considering the Dewey classification system from this perspective and then summarizing more current research carried out under the direction of the author with a grant from the National Science Foundation..
811	Measuring Readers' Failure at the Shelf	This paper is concerned with the availability of books known to be held by the Library.. It outlines a simple survey method whereby readers record the non-availability of books which they are looking for.. The survey has already been installed at four university libraries, but the results from only one library are considered here.. These results show how a librarian can find out the degree of non-availability or failure in any particular area of the library, the causes of failure, and even the particular items which are in heavy demand and not available.. They also provide information on the degree of co-operation by the readers, the number of titles failing once, twice, three times etc., the overlap of demand for popular books by different groups of borrowers, the waiting time for books that failed, the pattern of demand for particular books over a period of time, the relationship between failure and recall, the correlation of failure from one term to the next, and the relative use of books inside and outside the library.. From the results it was possible to recommend certain changes in library procedure which should have reduced failure, and to compare the titles of books failing in the Main Library with the holdings of a departmental library.. The time spent on the survey and the total cost of the survey are also given..
320	The Teachable Language Comprehender: A Simulation Program and Theory of Language	"The Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is a program designed to be capable of being taught to ""comprehend"" English text.  When text which the program has not seen before is input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relating each (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a large memory.  This memory is a ""semantic network"" representing factual assertions about the world. The program also creates copies of the parts of its memory which have been found to relate to the new text, adapting and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the new text.  By this means, the meaning of all text the program successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as that of the memory.  In this form it can be added into the memory. Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities for correctly relating text to the memory's prior content are to be taught to the program as they are needed.  TLC presently contains a relatively small number of examples of such assertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for expressing either of these are provided.  Thus the program now corresponds to a general process for comprehending language, and it provides a methodology for adding the additional information this process requires to actually comprehend text of any particular kind. The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions and capabilities for relating text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically. That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the system, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many other sentences in the future."
457	Information, Mechanism, and Meaning	In a day when it is hard enough in most fields of science to keep abreast of new and non-redundant literature, the publication of collected papers, like the estate of holy matrimony, is something not to be undertaken 'unadvisedly, lightly or wantonly'.  In the present case it would not have been considered at all but for the kindly initiative of my respected friend Professor Roman Jakobson, whose persistent encouragement alone overcame that distaste which most of us feel for our ten- to twenty-year-old productions and brought this first volume to the point of no return.  It is true that these exploratory papers were scattered among an unconscionably awkward selection of publications for anyone wanting to follow them up.  On the other hand, as most of them were written for specific occasions, each of which demanded some rehearsal of points covered in earlier essays, the resulting repetitiveness presented a special problem.  With occasional exceptions, redundancy could have been eliminated only at the cost of mutilating individual papers.  The solution adopted has been to leave almost all repetitive passages intact, offsetting in small print those that can be skipped without loss by readers of the earlier chapters.  Where some comment has seemed necessary, by way of foreword or postscript to the original papers, the passages added have been italicized.
258	Classification and Indexing in Science	The first problem, that of learning of a publication's existence, is tackled by a multiplicity of abstracting and indexing journals and other bibliographies, and, at local levels, by library catalogues and unnecessary overlapping among these services, while ensuring adequately comprehensive coverage, are very great.  But even if these were overcome, problems of the internal arrangement of these bibliographical aids would still remain.  It is not enough for them collectively to record every scientific publication.  The user must be able to find every such record, starting only with a subject on which he wants information.
1192	Out of the Dinosaurus; the evaluation of the National Lending Library for Science and Technology	The establishment of the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (NLL) has been one of the most significant events in British librarianship in the twentieth century.  This book attempts to trace the development of the library up to its merger into the impending British Library, and to describe the philosophies which shaped its policies and services.  I hope that the book will be of value to British and overseas librarians as a case study of the development of a national library, and also to students of librarianship and information work in that it may help them to appreciate the context in which the library has evolved and in which it now operates.
301	Staff Participation in Management In Large University Libraries	A CLR Fellowship in 1971-72 enabled the author to examine staff participation in the management of large academic libraries.. The report considers the climate of participation, preparation given the staff, areas of decision making, the role of the professional staff association, and the reaction of staff to such participation..
1007	Library Systems Analysis Guidelines	This book aims primarily to provide guidelines for library administrators and library systems analysts in analyzing and evaluating existing operating systems and in designing new or improved ones.  In addition, we have found the material to be very useful in staff training programs conducted to ensure knowledgeable staff participation and cooperation in a systems study.  This guide is also adaptable for introducing library school students to the concepts of systems study in the library.
263	Classification Catalogue Code	The Author, the Dictionary and the Classified catalogues represent three successive stages in the order of evolution of the internal form of the Library Catalogue.  The classified form being the latest to evolve, the literature relating to it is comparatively scanty.  It is strikingly so in the form of a systematic code of rules for cataloguing.  While the number of codes for the Author Catalogue is fairly large and the number for the Dictionary Catalogue is also respectable, there appear to be few systematic and complete codes published in book-form for the Classified Catalogue. Hence this little venture, which is based on twenty-five years of experimentation and on the valuable reciprocal influence gained by its being taught to students of library science during the last twenty years. While the Call Numbers occurring in the examples given are constructed by the Colon Classification, the rules of this Code are not necessarily dependent on that scheme for their applicability.  They are all of general application, irrespective of the scheme of classification in use.
913	On the construction and care of white elephants	Although catalogue codes and standards have received much attention, there has been very little fundamental questioning of cataloguing principles and practice.  Basic questions in need of investigation include: whether individual libraries need catalogues of their own stock; how far printed  bibliographies could serve as a substitute; the functions catalogues are serving at present, and the actual demands placed on them; the nature of users and non-users, and the possible conflicts between the catalogue needs of librarians and non-librarians; the psychological factors of approachability and usability; whether standardization should over-rule local needs; whether catalogues should be designed for use by readers at all; the functions of printed national catalogues; the implications of increased co-operation and of the changing functions of libraries; what a catalogue entry should contain and how it should be arranged; and the possible administrative uses of catalogue data. Mechanization has made these questions of great urgency.
696	Computerized Drug Information services	To compare computerized services in chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, and clinical medicine of pharmaceutical interest, equivalent profiles were run on magnetic tape files of CA-Condensates, CBAC, Excerpta Medica, MEDLARS and Ringdoc.. The results of these searches, which covered individual chemical compounds used in pharmacology and medicine, are tabulated overlap of services, relative speed of citing references, and unique areas of journal coverage..
1127	Evaluation of Information Loss Probability in Indexing	"A practical technique is proposed for assessing the losses of relevance documents, on the basis of probabilistic methods, and for entering ""marked"" documents into the system.."
81	Indexing Consistency and Quality	"A measure of indexing consistency is developed based on the concept of ""fuzzy-sets"".. It assigns a higher consistency value if indexers agree on the more important terms.. Measures of the quality of an indexer's work and exhaustivity of indexing are also proposed.. Experimental data on indexing consistency is presented for certain categories of indexers; and consistency, quality, and exhaustivity values are compared and analyzed.. The analysis of indexing exhaustivity leads to the conclusion that the increase of information as a result of group indexing is a process analogous to Bradford's law of information scattering, Lotka's law of scientific productivity, and Zipf's law of vocabulary distribution.."
366	Economics of Approval Plans	Current budget strains on college and university libraries require a stepped-up search for operating economies.  The timely topic of economics of approval plans of the Third International Conference on Approval and Gathering Plans for Large and Medium Size Academic Libraries, held at the Ramada Inn, West Palm Beach, Florida, February 17-19, 1971, has thus generated considerable interest. The papers published here constitute, by and large, original research in this area.  The importance of these contributions can hardly be overestimated, since they will no doubt mold and influence collection development practices in the current imprint area.
16	Adopting the Library of Congress Classification System	This manual is designed to make it possible for any library to change efficiently to the Library of Congress Classification system.  Detailed procedures are outlined which may serve as exact models or as a series of suggested steps which have proven effective in actual use.  Most of the text deals with the necessary criteria for effecting the planning, making the preparations, selecting the tools, and establishing the procedures which are essential for a reclassification project.  Beyond this, considerable attention has been given to many of the problem areas of the LC Classification-series, biography, bibliography, law, PZ3 and PZ4.  In addition, the literature Tables VIIIa and IXa, two of the most frequently used tables throughout the entire class system, have been thoroughly explained and their application illustrated by a series of comprehensive examples.  Since the mechanics, production, and cost of catalogue card copy can significantly affect the flow of books to users, a chapter has been devoted to describing the use of Xerox copying machines in library operations.  Finally, an annotated bibliography of books and articles judged to be helpful in deciding to reclassify is included for those readers who wish to delve more deeply into the tortuous and frustrating 50-year history of the concept of centralized cataloging and classification.  The numbers enclosed in parentheses throughout the text refer to sources in the bibliography which relate to or support the arguments being advanced in any particular case.
1225	On semantic synthesis	This paper describes a system for the automatic synthesis of a text in a natural language (Russian). The primary characteristic of this system is its semantic nature and the plurality of its synthesis.
737	The Large Data Base File Structure Dilemma	This paper first presents a brief tutorial on the principal random file organization methods for handling two major applications - Transaction oriented systems and Information storage and retrieval systems.  It then addresses a particular large data base dilemma, not satisfactorily resolved by any of these methods, and which is currently under active investigation.  Two approaches to a solution are described.  One is called the hybrid inverted list; the other is based upon an old technique called super-imposed coding.  The former has been implemented and has recently been installed in an operational system.  Some statistics related to file characteristics in this application are provided, but operational cost and performance statistics are not yet available.
390	Factors Determining the Performance of Indexing Systems	The test results are presented for a number of different index languages using various devices which affect recall or precision.  Within the environment of this test, it is shown that the best performance was obtained with the group of eight index languages which used single terms.  The group of fifteen index languages which were based on concepts gave the worst performance, while a group of six index languages based on the Thesaurus of Engineering Terms of the Engineers Joint Council were intermediary.  Of the single term index languages, the only method of improving performance was to group synonyms and word forms, and any broader groupings of terms depressed performance.  The use of precision devices such as links gave no advantage as compared to the basic device of simple coordination.
895	Design Equations for Retrieval System Based on the Swets Model	Swets's theory of information retrieval allows the threads of document weighting formulae, probabilistic measures of effectiveness, and management theory to be woven into a coherent pattern.. Benefits of the theory are the beginnings of a quantitative description of retrieval languages, a clear distinction between retrieval 'systems' and 'language', a recognition that retrieval performance can be tailored to suit individual needs in a systematic way, and confirmation that question Generality is a pivotal feature of the retrieval process.. The hypotheses involved are still in need of rigorous experimental testing..
66	Psychology and Information	An aspect of the human use of information that has generally been overlooked in the automation in information services is the human tendency to locate information spatially.. Computer-based systems do not necessarily assign any unique role to spatial tags, and so a feature of considerable importance for the organization of the user's memory seems to have been largely overlooked.. The spatial dimension of human memory is discussed, and some suggestions are offered for exploiting it more effectively in the context of information retrieval services..
1048	Measurement of Satisfaction in Work and Retirement	The focus of the book can be summed up in its subtitle: A Strategy for the Study of Attitudes.  This strategy is developed by devoting considerable attention to the nature of the concept of satisfaction, and, particularly, to the requirements for scientifically adequate measures of satisfaction.  In fact, it is the emphasis on a comprehensive set of requirements for sound measurement, rather than on just one or two elements of it, which is the quality that sets this book apart from any previous report in the area of job satisfaction. Not the least of the values of this book is its basic utility for both academicians and practitioners.  For the former, it should serve as a powerful spur and guide to further fundamental research on the nature and correlates of satisfaction.  For too many years we in this area have been plagued by inadequately conceived and poorly developed measuring devices.  This has led to a plethora of studies each using a different scale or measuring instrument.  As a consequence, this has opened the door for almost anyone to claim the solution for making sense of the jigsaw pattern of findings relating to satisfaction.  At the very least, the present volume should provide researchers with a thoroughly developed measuring instrument that will allow comparability of results across studies.  If so, this may well bring some meaningful order to the present rather chaotically structured literature on job satisfaction.
464	Similarity Relations and Fuzzy Orderings	"The notion of ""similarity"" as defined in this paper is essentially a generalization of the notion of equivalence.. In the same vein, a fuzzy ordering is a generalization of the concept of ordering.. For example, the relation x >> y is a fuzzy linear ordering in the set of real numbers.. More correctly, a similarity relation, S is a fuzzy relation which is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.. Various properties of similarity relations and fuzzy ordering are investigated and, as an illustration, an extended version of Szpilrajn's theorem is proved.."
455	Fuzzy Sets	A fuzzy set is a class of objects with a continuum of grades of membership.. Such a set is characterized by a membership (characteristic) function which assigns to each object a grade of membership ranging between zero and one.. The notions of inclusion, union, intersection, complement, relation, convexity, etc., are extended to such sets, and various properties of these notions in the context of fuzzy sets are established.. In particular, a separation theorem for convex fuzzy sets is proved without requiring that the fuzzy sets be disjoint..
1283	"""Science Citation Index"" - A New Dimension in Indexing"	This unique approach underlies versatile bibliographic systems for communicating and evaluating information.
59	Opinion Paper	Although a large number of Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) Systems have been planned, implemented, and tested over the past few years, insufficient attention has been given to the collection and interpretation of important data needed for evaluation.. We describe some of the defects common to almost all of the reported systems, single out one recent report for detailed discussion and argue in favor of collection and correct interpretation of data on one important and frequently overlooked evaluation factor..
1035	Man-Machine Communication	This book is an introduction to the elements, methods, and problems of interactive systems and is tutorial in tone.  It is intended for both users and designers of conversational systems: those who actually operate them as well as those who design the overall systems in which they are used.  I would expect, primarily, to draw my readers from among the designers of information systems and such prospective users as teachers, writers, librarians, lawyers, design engineers, and professional managers. The book is a survey and is not intended as an exhaustive text.  The reader wishing to pursue any topic in detail will have to seek further, but I have provided references to help him do so.
89	Professional Standing and the Reception of Scientific Discoveries	The Matthew Effect occurs when scientists receive differential recognition for a particular scientific contribution depending on their location in the stratification system.  Merton originally introduced the concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors of multiple discoveries or collaborators.  In this paper the concept is generalized to apply to all scientific work.  If the Matthew Effect were to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should be influenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system. To test this hypothesis, data are drawn from several studies of similar design.  In each study we control for the number of citations papers received at time 2.  This enables us to look at groups of papers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2. We then see whether there were any differences in the reception of these papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author's location in the stratification system.  All the data indicate that assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important determinant of a paper's initial reception than any of the stratification variables.  However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality is influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work that is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery.  The Matthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigious points of the social system of science.  All other stratification variables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awards did not influence the speed of diffusion.  Data are presented that indicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are no more likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low- ranking scientists.  The Matthew Effect also serves to focus attention on the work of little-known men who collaborate with scientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibility of the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame.  A discussion is included of the relevance of these data for the study of resistance to scientific discoveries.
54	Simulation of Boolean Logic Constraints Through the Use of Term Weights	The evolution described below of one aspect of the NASA system and Technical Information Facility's machine search system may be of general interest to the documentation profession.
26	Indexing and Abstracting by Association	"This article discusses the possibility of exploiting the statistics of word co-occurrence in text for purposes of document retrieval. Co-occurrence is defined and related to the mental processes of authors and readers; several means of quantitative measurement of word co-occurrence are then scrutinized.  It is shown that the most strongly co-occurring word pairs, which are therefore ""associated"" in a statistical sense, can be represented in the form of an ""association map.""  The last half of the article presents two modes of use of association maps in literature searching."
255	What do Chemists Read?	Most British universities are spending at least 3000 pounds per year on chemical journals alone.  And this does not include any administration or binding costs which may be as much again.  Are the universities getting their money's worth out of these journals?  This survey of one particular chemistry department suggests that they are not.
753	Source of Citations and References for Analysis Purposes: A Comparative Assessment	The uses to which analysis of bibliographical references and citations can be put are categorized.. Five sources of references and citations are identified, and their advantages and disadvantages for various purposes assessed and compared.. Comparative studies of different sources are urged..
601	Some Implications of Automatic Recognition of Bibliographic Elements	A theoretical approach to the problem of converting printed bibliographic records to machine readable form is developed based on principles of system analysis.. Experience from several recent projects conducted by the Institute of Library Research, University of California, are used to illustrate how this theoretical approach is currently being tested prior to implementation in a large scale conversion project..
961	An Operations Research Study of a Variable Loan and Duplication Policy at the University of Lancaster	"The Library Research Unit of the University of Lancaster used an Operations Research (O.R.) approach to recommend changes in loan and duplication policies in the university library.. The ""variable"" loan and duplication policy which was developed is described and also the considerable impact of implementation.. Other libraries are now adopting this kind of policy.. The work is presented as a case study in library O.R. .. The great importance of analyzing the structure of problems is stressed and the nature and usefulness of models is described.. For the most useful results, suitable librarians should be included in the research team.."
18	Selective Dissemination of Information	The present contribution does not duplicate previous studies but complements the earlier publications and closes the few gaps that exist in the literature prior to 1966 and after 1971.  Additionally, it is a bold attempt to evaluate critically and objectively the history of the mechanized selective dissemination of information (SDI) as reflected in the literature, from the initial description by Luhn (1958, 1961b, c) to the post-1970 period when the SDI boom began losing ground to the more popular on-line interactive systems.  The review therefore questions and interprets the concept of SDI, its implementation, and its evolution in the light of work performed by many companies, government agencies, universities, societies, and libraries during the last fourteen years.
708	An Efficient Design for Chemical Structure Searching. I. The Screens	A method has been developed for generating efficient screens for chemical structures.. Fragments are generated by an algorithm under control of file statistics.. The fragments obtained are normalized by weighting their code patterns.. Superimposition of these codes yields the screen codes for the structures..
523	The Cost_Performance of an On-Line, Free-Text Bibliographic Retrieval System	The cost-performance evaluation of the SUPARS system is reported.. SUPARS was an on-line, free-text bibliographic  retrieval system; cost-effectiveness data of such systems are not readily available.. In our evaluation, two measures of cost were employed: a computer processing charge expressed in dollars, and the number of documents retrieved (a measure of work that must be expended to review the retrieved items).. The measure of performance was an estimate of the recall ratio.. To obtain the requisite measures an experimental plan was developed in which experts searched the data base of Psychological Abstracts forming their queries from written statements of information needs.. These statements (along with the list of documents relevant to them) were produced by people with information problems.. Tallies were kept of the number of documents retrieved before each of the designed relevant items were found.. The major findings are noted below.. (1) Queries to the system employing simple Boolean operators (AND, OR) have better cost-performance characteristics than queries using more elegant searching operators.. (2) On-demand access to the index or dictionary contributes sizeably to improving the cost-performance of the system.. (3) The argument is raised that human factors, such as the differences among users of a system, probably should be a major factor in the design, operation and evaluation of retrieval systems.. It appears that consideration of these factors will improve system cost-performance..
1378	Standards for Library Service: An International Survey	In recent years, it has become recognized that a country's documentation and library services, indispensable for all forms of economic, social and cultural development, should be considered as one co-ordinated information system and accordingly included in any national development plans.  However, planning can only be carried out if the necessary statistical data and other information are available.  Unesco therefore concluded a contract in 1968 with the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) for a survey of standards for library services currently recommended for libraries of all types in different countries.  The work was entrusted to F.N. Withers, a research fellow at the Polytechnic of North London School of Librarianship (United Kingdom).
311	Communication among Scientists and Engineers	Since 1966, the Johns Hopkins University Center for Research in Scientific Communication has been conducting studies of the information flow process - the production, dissemination, and assimilation of information - associated with nine scientific and engineering disciplines.  This process in most disciplines appears, from the dissemination point of view, to consume about five years - from the time a scientist begins his research until reports of his findings are cited in a review.  To date we have conducted over sixty studies of this process and, since one of the main goals of our program is to make genuine comparisons of the scientific communication associated with the disciplines being studied, we have standardized the procedures, instruments, and analyses in those of the major studies which were conducted for all disciplines. We will present findings from the major studies conducted to date in order (1) to indicate the types of data we have collected on approximately 30,000 scientists and engineers during the past three years; (2) to indicate some of the goals of our program; and (3) to suggest a preliminary picture of the communication structure of science, as our program has led us to perceive it.
987	CIP in Mid-1970	The history of the near-success of the 1958-59 experiment with cataloging in source and the subsequent refusal of the library community to accept its failure are punctuated by data from a recent survey of 591 libraries in IS categories regarding attitudes toward prepublication cataloging..
364	Economic Analysis of the Public Libraries	This study addresses itself to several questions important to all public libraries.  How should the library allocate its book budget?  What kinds of books should it tend to buy?  What types of households use the library?  Why do some households not use the library?  What is the cost of the various services provided by the library?  What specific steps can the library take to improve its services?  What are the library's options in choosing among the different circulation systems?  For how long should the library allow books to be checked out?  How frequently should overdue notices be sent out?  Is an investment in a security system worthwhile? We have studied these questions in the context of one public library - the Beverly Hills (California) Public Library - and have developed a methodology for determining answers to them, as well as to other questions that arose during our investigation.  Although answers will vary from library to library, our methodology is quite general and should prove useful at many public libraries.
905	Periodicals for the Small Bio-Medical and Clinical Library	Since the advent of periodical literature in the seventeenth century well over ten thousand journals have been published in the field of bio-medicine.  Many of these have ceased publication; others are only of local interest.  Still, approximately two thousand desirable periodicals in this field are being currently released.  As research and discovery are recorded in the journal literature, the greatest asset of a scientific library is its subscription list and periodical holdings.  It therefore becomes a major responsibility of such libraries to make this wealth of experimental data available to their readers.  When funds are limited, the selection of a periodical collection that will best serve the most urgent needs of the reader becomes of paramount importance.  A plan of highly selective purchasing must be adopted to prevent the improper use of funds.  Actual needs of the library must be at hand to carry out such a plan.
97	Bibliographical Citation Characteristics of the Psychological Journal Network in 1950 and in 1960	The aforementioned studies are related to the problem of information exchange in psychology. Journals are a part of the formal channel of scientific communication as well as storage elements for the summary accounts of research undertakings. Analysis of bibliographical citations thus can reveal certain characteristics of the pattern of information flow created by scientists in their work.  The potential usefulness of this type of investigation is increased when it becomes possible to examine the trends through time of the communication network under consideration, and also when different communication networks can be compared. The present paper deals with some of the characteristics of bibliographical citations in the same 21 psychological journals published both in 1950 and in 1960. The list of journals used, along with the abbreviations to be used here, is given in Table 1; it includes 8 journals published by the American Psychological Association and 13 journals published by other organizations.
871	Analysis of Search Key Retrieval on a Large Bibliographic File	Two research keys (4,5 and 3,3) are analyzed using a probability formula on a bibliographic file of 857,725 records.. Assuming random requests by record permits the creation of a predictive model which more closely approximates the actual behavior of a search and retrieval system as determined by a usage survey..
1415	Computer-Based Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) Service for Faculty Using Library of Congress Machine-Readable Catalog (MARC) Records	"From November 1966 through June 1968 the Library of Congress conducted a pilot project involving the weekly distribution of its traditional 3x5 catalog cards in machine-readable form.. The MARC records provided a search data base for an experiment in current awareness service designed to furnish faculty with biweekly lists of bibliographic notices of new monographs in their specified fields of interest.. Of the 298 social sciences faculty members queried about their interest in participating, 209 (70 percent) responded affirmatively.. Only 40 participants could be accommodated, so they were chosen in proportion to the number of faculty members in each department or school:  anthropology-l, business-10, economics-3, education-15, government-4, history-4, and sociology-3.. An ""interest"" statement from each faculty member was translated into both Library of Congress classification numbers (e.g., E6ll) and subject heading terms, i.e., elements of discrete heading separated by a comma, dash, parenthesis, or period (e.g., U.S.--HIST.--CIVIL WAR--PRISONERS, EXCHANGE OF becomes six terms:  U/S/HIST/CIVIL WAR/PRISONERS/EXCHANGE OF).. The resulting ""interest profiles"" were recorded on punched cards for computer matching with subject headings and class numbers.. The weighted term search strategy was used in comparing profiles with MARC records.. Each profile was assigned a ""cutoff weight"" or ""hit level"" of 6.. Subject heading terms were assigned positive or negative weights so that the sum of weights on matching terms would be equal to, exceed, or be less than the hit level, thereby appropriately causing or preventing the selection of a particular record.. All class numbers were assigned a weight of 6 so that a hit would occur on any matching number.. Three computer programs were employed in producing the SDI lists.. Program Extract used MARC Master Tapes as input and extracted the card number (accession number), subject heading terms, and class number for current records; Program Retrieve compared these terms and class numbers with those in the profiles and recorded the card numbers for ""hits""; Program Print compared these card numbers with those on complete MARC records and printed three copies of each record to be sent to the faculty.. One copy was for the faculty member's own use; one was to be evaluated and returned; and one was to be used for making recommendations to the library.. Subject headings proved to be more effective in searching the MARC file mainly because multiple subject headings may be assigned to each record, whereas there is only one class number; and a hit often occurred on a record's second or third heading.. The SDI system performed well in selecting performed well in selecting relevant records, and overall evaluations were highly favorable.. Some 73 percent of notices received by faculty members were for works judged new to the faculty.  The majority felt that the SDI service provided an automatic, regular  notification of new works.. They felt that it usually brought works to their attention quicker than other sources; it informed them of items they otherwise would have missed; it furnished a compact source listing books in all but only their fields; it required very little time; and it provided a convenient means for making library recommendations and therefore increased the amount of recommending done.. All faculty expressed a desire to have SDI service continued.."
334	Concepts and Subject Headings	Librarians are known for their organizational work with recorded knowledge.  Information storage and retrieval are two well-known, basic functions associated with this work.  A search of the literature of library science reveals that these functions have not been examined to any significant degree from the users' point of view.  This is true in regard to library catalogs and library subject headings.
468	Analysis of On-line Searching Costs	A project was undertaken to discover the major determinants of the costs of searching, on-line, on a practical reference retrieval system (SCISEARCH).. The methodology and some results of this project are reported.. Controlled searches were undertaken to isolate the effect of each of a number of variables.. A model involving several of the major variables was then developed.. The general approach proved to be (in this case) both feasible and useful..
820	Studies to Compare Retrieval Using Titles with that Using Index Terms. SDI from 'Nuclear Science Abstracts'	A Selective dissemination of Information service based on computer scanning of Nuclear Science Abstracts tapes has operated at Harwell since October 1968.. Users' interest profiles are constructed using Euratom index terms and NSA subject categories assigned to each item in NSA.. The performance of the mechanized SDI service has been compared with that of the pre-existing current awareness service which is based on visual scanning of journals and reports by information staff.. The visual service was found to be providing an important service of good currency and high precision, about 85%, to a limited number of users.. the mechanized service is less selective and of lower precision, approximately 50%, but can be expanded more readily.. In order to compare the effectiveness of Euratom index terms and words on titles for computer SDI matching, an experiment was set up in which sixty users of the mechanized service assessed NSA document notifications which were generated by matching either index terms and subject categories, or words in titles and subject categories, without being aware of the method of matching.. Over 10,000 document assessments, fron six issues of NSA were returned.. The average precision was 45.6% for index terms and 47.3% for title words.. Index terms retrieved more documents, in the ratio 1.13:1, but both systems missed many relevant documents retrieved by the other.. Index terms retrieved only 58% of the relevant documents selected by titles.. The converse ratio was 51%.. No significant effects of document types or subject on the relative effectiveness of two matching systems were found, but when the results were analyzed by title length it appeared that for titles longer than about 100 characters title words gave recall equal to that of index terms, though with a lower precision.. A detailed study of samples of items found by visual scanning but missed by computer matching or found by one computer method but not by the other, was made to identify reasons for failure..
1365	Centralization vs. Decentralization: A Location Analysis Approach for Librarians	An application of location theory to the question of centralized versus decentralized library facilities for a university, with relevance for special libraries is presented.  Locating university libraries near classrooms, offices, and dormitories requires a larger budget than combining these libraries into a centralized facility.  Yet there is a cost to the university community which does not appear in the university budget - a cost in time, energy, and decreased use resulting from locating the library a longer distance from users.  The analysis provides models for a single library, for two or more libraries, or for decentralized facilities.
968	The Ecology of Privacy	The purpose of this article is to discuss the part played by the library environment in regulating interaction between people.
250	Centralized Processing for Academic Libraries; final report of the Colorado Academic Libraries Book Processing Center; the first six months of operation	This is the final report of the Colorado Academic Libraries Book Processing Center (CALBPC) project.  The CALBPC project was begun in 1965 by nine academic libraries in Colorado in an effort to establish a centralized acquisition and processing center.  The report of Phase I-II, completed in June 1968, dealt primarily with a general feasibility study, the design of the central system, costs of acquiring and processing in nine libraries and a number of related concerns such as accounting, the congruence of approval plans and user attitudes toward library services. This report focuses on the experimental operations which were concluded officially on September 30, 1969.  Whereas the Phase I-II study dealt with the theory and principles upon which a system might be based, we are presently concerned with the pragmatics of book processing, the obstacles encountered, and the solutions achieved. Although this report deals primarily with cooperative acquisitions and processing, we believe it also contributes to a better understanding of cooperative programs.  The experiment was designed to monitor operations throughout the acquisition/ cataloging cycle.  Performance and cost measurements were made on most internal and external aspects of the system.  Monitoring also extended into the participating libraries where a product acceptance study was conducted.  A secondary objective of the project was to observe the relationships which formed between the participants and the central agency, such as the interface of systems and the human interaction of participants and the Center.
1285	Networks of Scientific Papers	This article is an attempt to describe in the broadest outline the nature of the total world network of scientific papers.  We shall try to picture the network which is obtained by linking each published paper to the other papers directly associated with it.
1198	Proceedings.  Conference on Interlibrary Communications and Information Networks	Librarians and information scientists are vitally concerned with network development for a number of important reasons. First, the network concept implies removal of all geographic barriers to knowledge; this is made possible by advances in telecommunications technology.  Second, a network implies equal access by any individual for any purpose to the sum total of the nation's knowledge resources; this has been a long-standing educational goal.  And third, a network implies positive redirection of the basic professional goals and objectives of librarianship and information science.
486	Relevance Assessments and Retrieval System Evaluation	Two widely used criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of information retrieval system are, respectively, the recall and the precision.. Since the determination of these measures is dependent on a distinction between documents which are relevant to a given query and documents which are not relevant to that query, it has sometimes been claimed that an accurate, generally valid evaluation cannot be based on recall and precision measures.. A study was made to determine that effect of variations in relevance assessments on the average recall and precision values used to measure retrieval effectiveness.. Using a collection of 1200 documents in information science for test purposes, it is found that large scale differences in the relevance assessments do not produce significant variations in average recall and precision.. It thus appears that properly computed recall and precision data may represent effectiveness indicators which are generally valid for many distinct user classes..
295	An Approach to the Measurement of Use and Cost of a Large Academic Research Library System: A Report of a Study Done at Columbia University Libraries	A description of the methodology used in collecting performance data in a large academic research library is given.. Twelve types of surveys used to measure and evaluate users, services, and materials were developed and conducted during the period 1968/69 at Columbia University libraries and later evaluated.. Sample results are included.. Costs of providing research services were found to be 64 percent versus 36 percent for instructional services..
1314	Popper's Mystification of Objective Knowledge	For Popper, science is the very epitome of objective knowledge.  The central papers of his latest book argue and elaborate on this theme.  He says: All work in science is work directed towards the growth of objective knowledge.  We are workers who are adding to the growth of objective knowledge as masons work on a cathedral. I will first make some preliminary points about the word 'objective'. This will give substance to issues which are in danger of becoming too rarefied.  Second, I will outline Popper's account of objectivity.  Third, I will argue that despite the value of what he says, his approach is seriously misleading.  I will propose a formula for systematically transforming Popper's theses and exposing what is important in them.  This 'transformative method' points the way towards an entirely different conception of what makes knowledge objective.
224	The Implementation, Evaluation, and Refinement of a Manual SDI Service	The Missouri Institute of Psychiatry Library has implemented an inexpensive, manual SDI (Selective Dissemination of Information) service based upon the monthly issues of Index Medicus.. The implementation and refinement of the system are documented, and the very favorable response to the system is examined.. The SDI service is compared to Current Contents, with the finding that 60 percent of the SDI participants prefer it to Current Contents.. For this select portion of researchers the Index Medicus SDI is the more suitable mode of current awareness.. For a significant portion of the MIP staff, however, the score of Index Medicus is too restricted to suitable replace Current Contents.. All SDI users find it highly acceptable curent awareness service for use in addition to Current Contents and have indicated the desire to continue participation in the service..
155	Subject Relations in Science/Technology Literature	The analysis of citations has often been employed to indicate the use of the literature of science and technology.  Citation is only an indicator of use, not an accurate measure, and like all such indicators has defects. Differences between indicators have been discussed elsewhere. Despite these defects, an examination of citations does enable one to sample acts of literature use within a large community.  The study reported here was directed, in fact, to all United Kingdom authors of science/ technology publications in a given year, and because of its width, and the type of analysis performed, is considered to be worth reporting.  The study was primarily undertaken to obtain comparable information about social science literature, and this has been reported elsewhere.
361	Documentation	"Since the first publication of this work Dr. Bradford has died, and, a further edition now being called for, an attempt has been made to recognize if not to deal with some criticisms expressed on the first edition. The principal one was that whereas the book was entitled ""Documentation"" it dealt in the main with the Universal Decimal Classification, which Bradford did much to develop, but that it neglected other aspects and instruments of the subject of which the UDC is only one, even if an important one, of various techniques."
959	Measures of Library Effectiveness	Mathematical models of library operations are presented, allowing managers to estimate measures of effectiveness for a library.. These models describe the amount of use made of resources by a user in a visit, the distribution of book circulation in a collection, the dependence of circulation on time, and the effect of multiple copies on user satisfaction.. Predictions are made on the basis of the models of the consequence of breaking of central library into branch libraries.. The effect, in terms of frustrated use, of removing the least-used books from a collection is discussed, as are strategies for for duplication.. The emphasis is on facilitating getting results from models; for this purpose graphic techniques supplement the mathematical formulas..
1043	The MARC Pilot Project: The Final Report	The MARC project has progressed from a pilot to test the feasibility of a distribution service of centrally produced machine-readable cataloging data to a full-scale operational system in the design stages in two short years. The library community, both here and abroad, has accepted MARC and recognizes its potential for the future.  The single most significant result of MARC has been the impetus to set standards.  There is no doubt that eventually standards would have been designed for machine-readable bibliographic records, character sets, and codes for place and language.  MARC accelerated standardization and still more important, the standards are being set and agreed to be a large segment of the library community. The cooperation among the producers and users of bibliographic description has been a rewarding experience.
603	The Efficiency of MEDLARS Titles for Retrieval	Previous research has indicated that the titles rather than index terms would, in the standard MEDLARS system, gave lower Recall but higher Precision.. A title searching technique is described which allows the number of references retrieved to be fixed before a search commences.. With this technique the greater applicability of title-terms offsets their relative paucity.. The title-searching technique is tested using queries put to MEDLARS.. These queries were not specially solicited for the test.. Title searching is compared with the standard MEDLARS index term search and with an index term search with fixed output size.. For equal output sizes, Title searching retrieves 4 relevant references for every 5 retrieved by index term searching.. Thus the relative retrieval efficiency of Title and Index terms is so close that the choice of one method or the other must be primarily on economic grounds..
1036	The Management of Innovation	All the research reported in this book arose out of an attempt, some years ago, to study an industrial concern as a 'community of people at work', that is, in much the same terms one would use in a study of conduct and relationships in a village, an urban neighborhood, or a small primitive community.  This aim was never realized, because it soon became evident that the social structure of the factory interlocked with, and often mirrored, that of the small isolated town in which it was situated.  The wider study which then appeared necessary was not practicable and the enquiry petered out rather inconclusively, assuming its present significance only in the context of later studies.
1201	Communication and Epidemic Processes	It is pointed out that communication processes can be represented as epidemic processes.. Consequently, epidemic theory can be applied to the study of any process in which information is transmitted within a population.. The members of such populations need not be human beings but could be micro-organisms or even machines.. The fundamental notion of stability of an epidemic process is introduced and a stability theorem is derived.. A mechanism, called an information retrieval process, which instigates an epidemic process is defined, certain general properties of the mechanism are established and the means of controlling it are discussed.. Pontryagin's maximum principle is applied to the problem of achieving optimal control of an epidemic process and it is shown that stability of the process is equivalent to stability in the sense of Lyapunov.. This result makes it possible to determine the conditions for stability without knowledge of the solution of the differential equations which represent the process..
758	A Scientific Theory of Classification and Indexing and Its Practical Application	A classification is a theory of the structure of knowledge.. From a discussion of the nature of truth, it is held that scientific knowledge is the only knowledge which can be regarded as true.. The method of induction from empirical data is therefore applied to the construction of a classification.. Items of knowledge are divided into uniquely definable terms, called isolates, and the relations between them, called operators.. It is shown that only four basic operators exist, expressing appurtenance, equivalence, reaction, and causation; using symbols for these operators, all subjects can be analysed in a linear form called an analet.. With the addition of the permissible permutations of such analets, formed according to simple rules, alphabetical arrangement of the first terms provides a complete, logical subject index.. Examples are given, and possible difficulties are considered.. A classification can then be constructed by selection of deductive relations, arranged in hierarchical form.. The nature of possible classifications is discussed.. It is claimed that such an inductively constructed classification is the only true representation of the structure of knowledge, and that these principles provide a simple technique for accurately and fully indexing and classifying any given set of data, with complete flexibility..
986	MEDLARS:  A Summary Review and Evaluation of Three Reports	The MEDLARS (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System) system at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) has over the past few years been one of the most significant and one of the most publicized automated bibliographic information retrieval systems.  Over two hundred articles on it have appeared in American newspapers and popular magazines, in specialized medical journals throughout the world, and in a variety of library journals.  The publicity that has attended this project has, in a way, been unfortunate, for it has presented an exaggerated picture of the system and its accomplishments which has only made the sceptics more skeptical; and it has obscured in part the examination of MEDLARS' real accomplishments.  There has to date been very little careful outside analysis and evaluation of MEDLARS.  Over 50 percent of all the articles listed in the bibliography in Austin's report, and virtually all the substantive ones, represent the work of persons closely connected with NLM or the development of the MEDLARS system.  Their judgement on the effectiveness of the system and its overall value cannot help but be colored by this connection.
1072	GREMAS - A System for Classification and Documentation in Organic Chemistry	"The authors of this essay were faced with the task of organizing a documentation office in which a large number of publications and patents in chemistry would have to be processed.  This large collection would be made available to a large group of elements without restrictions. To permit a large frequency of use, and to maintain this also with increases in file sizes, it becomes necessary to limit especially that faction of the task which consists in the retrieval activities paper. Savings in the retrieval activity are possible only at the expense of greater effort in indexing and by heavier use of technical aids.  We have taken the second path by consciously applying the principles	to a highly detailed faceted classification."
168	Aspects of the Theory of Syntax	"The idea that a language is based on a system of rules determining the interpretation of its infinitely many sentences is by no means novel.  Well over a century ago, it was expressed with reasonable clarity by Wilhelm von Humboldt in his famous but rarely studied introduction to general linguistics (Humboldt, 1836).  His view that a language ""makes infinite use of finite means"" and that its grammar must describe the processes that make this possible is, furthermore, a outgrowth of a persistent concern, within rationalistic philosophy of language and mind, with this ""creative"" aspect of language use (for discussion, see Chomsky, 1964, forthcoming).  What is more, it seems that even Panini's grammar can be interpreted as a fragment of such a ""generative grammar,"" in essentially the contemporary sense of this term. This monograph is an exploratory study of various problems that have arisen in the course of work on transformational grammar, which is presupposed throughout as a general framework for the discussion.  What is at issue here is precisely how this theory should be formulated.  This study deals, then, with questions that are at the border of research in transformational grammar.  For some, definite answers will be proposed; but more often the discussion will merely raise issues and consider possible approaches to them without reaching any definite conclusions."
526	On-Line Information retrieval as a Scientists Tool	The use of an on-line information retrieval system by the scientists themselves is described.. MEDUSA was designed to allow physicians to interrogate the MEDLARS data base.. A brief description is given of the system and details of an experiment to test its effectiveness.. Search formulation prepared on-line by medical research workers are compared for recall and precision with the same requests formulated by search editors in the normal way.. The results show that physicians can use an on-line system effectively..
724	Document Access	Long-range, copies of needed documents will be rapidly and inexpensively supplied to users in libraries or at their desks by querying an electronic network linking document sources (central libraries and publishers).  In the interim, local libraries will slowly progress through increased dependence on local holdings of microfilm to development of and dependence on regional, national, and discipline networks for access to most of the documents desired. These developments will depend, however, on resolution of the copyright problem by mechanisms that will fairly remunerate the copyright owners.  As background, and because radical change is not expected overnight, the paper also reviews conventional and sophisticated storage systems, including microfilm, facsimile, and video; copyright aspects; costs; need for speed; other user considerations; and standards.
698	Encoding and Decoding WLN	This paper deals with the encoding and decoding of a Wiswesser Line Notation (WLN).. This problem so far has been addressed only from the point of human.. This paper discusses the encoding and decoding with exactness suitable for a computer, and is an outgrowth of a computer program now in operation at NIH which automatically encodes and decodes WLN..
24	Libraries and Technological Forces Affecting Them	1.  What do we mean by technology and what kind of technological forces are we concerned with? 2.  Why is it important to be concerned with technology in thinking about the future of libraries? 3.  What kinds of technology are particularly important for libraries? 4.  How can this technology be applied today? 5.  What can we foresee for the future, as we move toward the year 2000? 6.  What, if anything, should we do tomorrow to try to get from here to here?
559	Introduction to University Library Administration	The last ten years have witnessed the growth of an intense public interest in university affairs.  Almost anything to do with universities is now headline news.  Previously such attention as they did receive was limited to brief reports in sober middle class newspapers of appointments, awards and meetings, leavened once a year by an obligatory account in all newspapers of the Boat Race. All this has changed: as Michael Befoff comments in his book The Plateglass Universities (having made the foregoing points and more besides), what were once ivory towers have now become goldfish bowls. He goes on to give the obvious explanation for the change: universities are of public interest because they are now almost wholly supported by the taxpayers' money.  They represent a massive investment on the part of the government, and consequently are expected to yield a vitally important return in trained and educated manpower. Over the last twenty years government expenditure in this country on universities has risen from four million pounds a year to more than two hundred million pounds a year.  The total university student population is in excess of two hundred thousand, and teaching and research staff number approximately twenty-five thousand.
200	Mechanization of Library Procedures in the Medium-sized Medical Library	"Mechanical means for expediting library work have been considered for many years, as an examination of the early pages of Library Journals bears out. The very first volume of the forerunner of the Bulletin, the Medical Library and Historical Journal, moreover, contained an article on the use of the ""typewriting machine"" in cataloging.  Telephones have long been accepted as library machines, and, except for unusual items, hand bookbinding has given way to machine-bound books. Nevertheless, when the term ""machine methods"" is used for libraries today, the prevailing idea is that expensive and complicated electronic equipment must be employed, and, since few libraries are able to afford such equipment for themselves, it is generally assumed that none but the largest libraries (the Library of Congress or the National Library of Medicine, for example) will be able to employ already existing mechanical methods or devise systems specifically applicable to their own situations."
516	Problems in Information Retrieval: Logical Jumps in the Expression of Information	In a structured data base, such as that obtained when information is indexed in a format including explicit relations, retrieval of all relevant items in response to a question may, in some cases, be restricted by technicalities of the structure.. Condensations in the form of logical jumps, or the omission of a concept with one relation out of a string of three concepts with two interstitial relations, have been investigated by two different methods, in order to overcome one of these technicalities.. Thirty-two rules are proposed which could permit the automatic condensation of either of both the stored information and the question, when the concepts and relations are in the form of linear or string display.. Nine rules are proposed for condensation of angular structures.. Other type of logical jump and abbreviation are discussed, together with related studies of expansions and inference steps..
246	Cataloging Rules ad Principles	The present study was undertaken pursuant to an assignment by the Library of Congress.  The author was directed to prepare, for the Board on Cataloging Policy and Research of the A.L.A. Division of Cataloging and Classification, a general analysis of the ALA cataloging rules for author and title entry, with special consideration of the rules for corporate authors, and a discussion of the objectives and principles which should underlie a revision of the rules.  The first three parts of the report are directed, respectively, to the three aspects of this assignment.  The fourth part of the report was added to deal with general questions raised by readers of a preliminary draft of this report.
1356	The Scientist Versus Machine Search Services: We are the Missing Link	To take advantage of computerized data bases to improve their services to scientists without incurring prohibitive in-house expense, the librarians at the  Boulder Laboratories have campaigned to increase awareness and utilization via personal interviews, seminars, surveys, and critiques.  Data bases most studied were DDC, NASA, SIE, ASCA, and the University of Georgia.  The conclusions:  1) The scientist needs continuous  personal assistance by a librarian or information specialist in order to make effective use of data bases. 2) As local retailer, the librarian has an accordingly important role to play now and in the future, a role at present generally ignored.
828	A Study of Current Awareness Publications in the Neurosciences	Mailed questionnaires were used to study the use of two printed current awareness devices in specialized areas of the neurosciences, one manually prepared and the other a product of MEDLARS.  The study determined who uses each publication, how much, for what purpose, and with what degree of success.  A major purpose was to discover how valuable the publications are to users and what impact they have had on their own research or professional practice as well as on their information seeking behaviour.  Comparisons are made between the results for the two publications.  Some conclusions are drawn on information seeking behaviour in the neuroscience community and on requirements for effective current awareness services in this field.
384	Evaluation of the World Food Literature	This publication presents the culmination of a concerted International effort to survey the relevant world's scientific and technological literature for its food science and technology content as a preliminary step towards the establishment of a comprehensive abstracting and documentation service in this field.
144	The Art of Computer Programming	The process of preparing programs for a digital computer is especially attractive because it not only can be economically and scientifically rewarding, it can also be an aesthetic experience much like composing poetry or music.  This book is the first volume of a seven-volume set of books that has been designed to train the reader in the various skills which go into a programmer's craft.
1432	The Ranking of Biomedical Periodicals from the Indian Scientist's Point of View	The output of scientific literature has been increasing exponentially since the second quarter of this century.. New journals in specialized branches of science keep appearing and established periodicals either multiply the number of volumes per year or split into different titles covering narrower subject areas in order to cope with the flow of communications received for publication.. The limited resources or libraries, particularly in the developing countries, do not permit them to increase library space or budget at a rate commensurate with this rise in publication.. Consequently research libraries in such countries as India must be highly selective in their acquisition programmes and to do so without detriment to the research interests of the institution they serve, they urgently need dependable data on the ranking of periodicals according to the particular research needs of their respective countries.. In this article an attempt is made to rank periodicals in the field of the biomedical sciences, from the point of view of the Indian scientist.. This method may also be followed in the libraries of other developing countries by changing the citing journals according to their country's needs..
825	Progress in Documentation: The Development of Precis: A Theoretical and Technical History	Before starting to trace the development of PRECIS to its theoretical beginnings I shall describe the system briefly in its present form.  This will serve not only as an introduction for those who are not familiar with the system, but will also help to explain the relevance of some of the historical sections which follow, in which we shall see how a machine-produced alphabetical indexing system, based on a syntax derived from a study of natural language, developed out of research into principles for a new general classification. PRECIS, or the PREserved Context Indexing System, differs in some respects from traditional alphabetical indexes and lists of subject headings. Like the system developed by Coates for the British Technology Index, PRECIS consists essentially of a set of working procedures, not a prescribed list of terms or phrases.  The system is firmly based upon the concept of an open-ended vocabulary, which means that terms can be admitted into the index at any time, as soon as they have been encountered in literature. Once a term has been admitted, its relationships with other terms are handled in two different ways, distinguished as the syntactical and the semantic sides of the system.
1284	Scientific Information Exchange in Psychology The immediate dissemination of research findings is described for one science.	The immediate dissemination of research findings is described for one science.
1411	Probability Theory	This book is a textbook intended for those generally familiar with mathematics who are interested in the technical applications of probability theory, in particular of the theory of shooting [?]. The book will also be of interest to engineers in other fields who find it necessary to use the theory of probability. The book is distinguished by the major attention it pays to new branches of probability theory which are important in application (for example, the theory of probabilistic processes, information theory, the theory of mass servicing, etc.).
1290	The Future of Scientific Journals	A computer-based system will enable a subscriber to receive a personalized stream of papers.
226	A Behavioral Approach to Historical Analysis	To issue a clarion call for historians to adopt a behavioral approach to their subject may seem as up-to-date and exciting as last month's newspaper, for it is the academic fashion today to argue the utility of social science theory in the writing of history.  Books and articles issue forth from the presses in seeming profusion advocating and even occasionally demonstrating such an approach.  Yet these many pages fail in three significant ways to accomplish the end they nominally espouse and which I urge.
618	Interrelationships of Scientific Journals	A series of models of the interrelationship of scientific journals has been developed from the cross citing amongst 275 journals in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology.. The data source was the Journal Citation Index (JCI), a file derived from the Science Citation Index.. The JCI consists of a journal by journal tabulation of citings to and from each journal in the index.. A large amount of consistency was found between the citing characteristics of the journals in the different scientific fields, with quite clear boundaries between fields and a few well known cross disciplinary journals as cross field information links.. The separate disciplines appear to relate to each other in an orderly manner, with a natural sequence:  mathematics --> physics --> chemistry --> biochemistry --> biology.. Within disciplines the journals form fully transitive hierarchies with very few relational conflicts..
1304	Citation Analysis	The Science Citation Index is a valuable and powerful tool when used for the purpose for which it was intended, as an aid in literature search.  It also invites a variety of statistical investigations, which must, however, be considered with prudence, since they may lead to misleading results.  No matter how cautiously the authors express themselves, the casual readers,  that is the majority, will treat the results as established facts and forget about the assumptions underlying them.  This is also happening with the computer output for economic models, which is accepted as if it were experimental observation.
272	Professionalism Reconsidered	The question of librarianship as a profession is considered here in terms of the three key relationships of a professional-client, organizational and professional.. Professional practice in this field is thus cast against accepted norms and standards of professional behavior.. This critical assessment suggests that librarianship falls far short of the professional model.. Major shifts in the nature of the services performed by librarians and in their bureaucratic relationships will be required if librarianship is to advance.. The contributions of the professional associations and of library schools to the advancement of the process of professionalization is also analyzed.. Progress in the field is viewed to be inextricably tied to the success or failure which librarianship achieves in its quest for true professional attainment..
1448	Vocabulary Control for Information Retrieval	This book deals with properties of vocabularies for indexing and searching document collections; the construction, organization, display, and maintenance of these vocabularies; and the vocabulary as a factor affecting the performance of retrieval systems.  Most of the text is concerned with vocabularies for post- coordinate retrieval systems, with special emphasis on thesauri and machine-based systems.  Vocabularies for pre-coordinate systems (e.g., alphabetical subject catalogs and classified catalogs) are discussed only briefly to provide historical perspective and for the light they shed on the problems o vocabulary control in general.  This type of vocabulary is well covered in existing texts.
1458	Legal Restrictions on Exploitation of the Patent Monopoly: An Economic Analysis	"The patent laws confer on a patentee power to exclude all others from making, using or selling his invention.  In furtherance of a constitutionally recognized goal - ""To promote the Progress of Science and the useful Arts"" - Congress has thus adopted a constitutionally authorized means - ""securing...to Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective...Discoveries.""  The constitutional clause is remarkable in several respects.  Its recognition of the possibility that invention might require encouragement implies not only that technological innovation is desirable but also that, but for legal subsidization, the quantity of innovation forthcoming would or might be less than optimum. This recognition, coming on the morn of an era during which the tendency of a free market to achieve optimality in all activities was greatly and religiously overestimated, prompts brief inquiry into the soundness of the supposition."
686	New Developments in Primary Journal Publication	"The form and function of the journal as a medium of communication between scientists, that is, one scientist talking to another, have not changed greatly these past 100 years.	But during that time, the journal has evolved to a highly effective medium for meeting the scientists' needs for publication, distribution, storage, and retrieval of scientific information.  Kessler describes the journal as the most ""successful and ubiquitous carrier of scientific information in the entire history of science.""  And the scientific paper, he adds, ""is such a marvelous and commodating invention that we seem to take it for granted and forget that it has form and structure that fit its function."""
677	Procedures for Converting Systematic Names of Organic Compounds into Atom-Bond Connection Tables	Simultaneously with its development of a computer-based Chemical Compound Registry System, Chemical Abstracts Service is devising procedures for automatically converting systematic names of organic compounds into atom- bound connection tables which can be manipulated by computer.  A study of systematic Chemical Abstracts (CA) index names has resulted in a dictionary of word roots used in the names and in step-by-step procedures for converting names to connection tables.  Statistical studies of nomenclature in CA indexes show that these procedures are applicable not only to current nomenclature, but also generally to names in past indexes.  Procedures have been written which are applicable to the majority of names of carbon compounds, and the preparation of computer programs is now under way.
386	Informal Communication in Science: Its Advantages and its Formal Analogues	Formal and informal scientific communication are complementary; they must not be thought of as alternatives in the sense that, perhaps, certain messages are obtained exclusively through the printed word, the library, and the mechanized search-and-retrieval system, whereas others are obtained by the exclusive use of word-of-mouth and the telephone.  The much more typical event is one in which the receipt of a single message is secured by the successive interplay of these two kinds of communication.  For any given transaction between a scientist as a receiver of information and the channel that brings him that information usually has a history behind it and a future ahead of it that may be very relevant to the evaluation of the success of that transaction and to the prognosis of whether this kind of transaction will happen again with similar results.
598	Curricula in Information Science:  Analysis and Development	The Curriculum Committee of the Special Interest Group/Education Information Science of ASIS is charged with the responsibility for determining the scope and characteristics of information science programs in the US and Canada in terms of Curriculum developments and course offerings.  To fulfill this responsibility, questionnaires were developed to elicit reliable information concerning courses being offered relating to information storage and retrieval, information science and/or documentation.  The data requested included course levels, pre- and post-requisite courses, textbooks used, topics covered, frequency with which offered, etc. Responses were received from 45 schools, providing information about 185 courses and 242 topics.  Using several methods of clustering the data, it was difficult to arrive at firm results, because of the diversity and scatter of the topics included in this field.  It was therefore decided to hold a workshop of experts which would examine the validity of the questionnaire results. This workshop, using the Delphi technique to arrive at consensus, was held at the University of Pittsburgh on September 21-23, 1970.  Sixteen specialists in the field representing universities industry and government were brought together to participate.  Consensus was reached in identifying nine factors which contribute to the curriculum in information science and seven courses which constitute the core for the Master's program. The topics to be included in each of these courses were also isolated.
705	Comparative Searching of Computer Data Bases	Methods for retrieval of information on chemical compounds utilizing several computer data bases have been compared to determine scope of data base coverage. Queries for a single chemical, N-ethyl-@-methyl-m-trifluoromethylphenethylamine (fenfluramine) and generic chemicals (2-pyrrolidinones) were submitted to the services for searching through the recent literature.  Data bases employed included MEDLARS, Excerpta Medica, CA Condensates, CBAC, Ringdoc, Current Abstracts in Chemistry and Automatic New Structure Alert (ANSA).  Preparation of search questions is outlined and comparative results are reported indicating the yield from each data base.
249	Centralized Book Processing	This report summarizes the results of the fourteen-month feasibility study -- the Colorado Academic Libraries Book Processing Center project (CALBPC).  The report is organized under nine major sections: I. Background; II. Participating Libraries -- Operational Characteristics; III. Cost Analysis; IV. Business Office Procedures; V. The Book Processing Center; VI. Approval Plan Utilization; VII.  Mathematical Model/Simulation; VIII. Attitude Survey; IX. Conclusions and Recommendations.
765	Bradford's Law of Scattering	These authors collected a large number of references to a certain subject, and arranged the periodicals in which the references occurred in order of decreasing productivity.  Thus for applied geophysics they found (loc. cit., p. 112) 1 periodical containing 93 references, 1 containing 86, 4 containing 16, 49 containing 2, and 169 containing only 1 reference.  They then made cumulative totals for the two sets of figures, so that in the T most productive periodicals there occurred in all R references.  Bradford then plotted log T against R and his curves are reproduced as B and C in Fig. 1.  An exactly similar procedure for periodical references borrowed by Butterwick resulted in curve A.  In both A and B, after an initial steep rise (up to about R = 500), the curves approximate to a straight line, R = a log T + b.
619	Managing An Uncontrolled Vocabulary Ex Post Facto	Initiated as an experiment, supported by the Division of Medicinal Chemistry of Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, the operational retrospective retrieval service offered by BIOSIS, now in its eighth year, exploits a file created essentially without vocabulary control.. The file comprises some 40 million index access points to 1.87 million references in research biology announced in Biological Abstracts and BioResearch Index since September 1959.. A pragmatic program of file building criteria has been pursued, originally with modest support from the Office of Science Information Service of the National Science Foundation, which has provided improved retrieval and an annual summary of the vocabulary of the literature available to anyone interested (1)..
306	From Economic to Political Analysis of Library Decision Making	In general, the more critical the decision, the less useful a cost-benefit analysis is to library decision makers.. Political analysis is required, and Easton's conceptual framework is presented to suggest the utility of political analysis.. A list of normative issues is derived from raising descriptive questions about the politics of university libraries..
1088	Mathematical Approach to the Prediction of Scientific Discovery	In the field of symbolic logic at least, fundamental discoveries seem to follow patterns, suggesting that future discoveries may in some sense be predictable..
789	Social Science Literature Use in the UK as Indicated by Citations	A sample of citations made in 1965 United Kingdom social science literature has been analyzed according to subject, bibliographic form, country of origin, language, and date, and comparisons made with citations from science and technology literature.. The relative size of the outputs of and demands for literature in these fields are estimated, and the subject distribution of citation within social science.. The interrelations between source and cited subject are discussed.. Use as indicated by citation is compared with use measured  by loan demand on the National Lending Library..
302	"Applying ""Management by Objectives"" To the University Library"	"Many methods of library management are no longer sufficient to meet the more sophisticated demands of today.. A promising management technique for librarians is ""managements by objectives"", which helps to establish library goals, measure performance objectively, and to identify factors affecting an operation's final results.."
1310	Two Paradigms for Scientific Knowledge?	The growing interest in the sociology of science makes the publication of this collection of papers particularly timely because, in broad outline, it deals with the clash which occurs when the sociological approach makes incursions into the field normally occupied by philosophers of science.
214	Library Participation in a Biomedical Communication and Information Network	The experience of two libraries participating in the SUNY Biomedical Communication Network is described..  The history of the Network if briefly given together with its original aims and their current status.. Use of the terminals and formulation of queries are explained.. Figures are given for total costs, number of searches performed, and cost per search.. There is a account of the internal structure of the administration of the Network..
1006	Library Service to the Disadvantaged	This volume is intended mainly as a source book for project and program ideas for libraries now engaged in working with the disadvantaged or planning to do so.  It is also hoped that it will give an overview of the progress to date in work with the disadvantaged by bringing together much of the thinking and many of the ideas that have appeared in literature or in conferences in the last few years.
1353	How to Survive in Industry Cost Justifying Library Services	Two services provided by the Boeing Co. Aerospace Group Library - literature searches and reference/publication identification activities - were evaluated by written and oral surveys of the library's users.  The survey technique and cost savings reported by the two studies are discussed in addition to the beneficial impact of the survey results on high level corporate management.
1237	Public Libraries as Culture and Social Centers: the origin of the concept	This book is an attempt to trace the origins of non- book activities in public libraries, by which is meant the arrangement of fiestas, festivals, and exhibitions; the conduct of classes, contests, lectures, and excursions; the staging of plays, the exhibition of movies, the demonstration of karate and judo, and all similar activities not primarily concerned with books now carried on by public libraries. Since ideas about libraries, as well as librarians, have passed back and forth across the Atlantic with great facility, in this attempt to discover origins it seems wise to follow, however sketchily, developments in both America and Britain, and to note with some care what was happening in scholarly libraries, in popular libraries for the middle classes, and in libraries intended for the working classes.
1449	The Weapons Acquisitition Process: An Economic Analysis	"A distinctive feature of American weapons development and production is the use of private firms to carry forward most of the effort.  This volume is primarily concerned with the government- business relationships within which these activities take place. Our title reflects our emphasis.  Weapons Acquisition is defined to include the conception, development, and production of technically advanced weapons for ultimate use by the armed forces.  Process emphasizes the flow of decisions and activities during weapons programs, including the actions, reactions, and interactions of government agencies and defense contractors.  Economic Analysis indicates our concern with how these activities and relationships affect the quality, time, cost, and value outcomes of weapons programs. The principal objective of this volume is increased knowledge of these facets of weapons development and production.  Such an objective classified the volume as a social science, rather than administrative study.  Yet most social science research, however ""pure"" the form, is ultimately directed at changing public policy.  That is the intention here, but this book does not conclude with a specific set of public policy recommendations.  Rather, it is largely limited to providing understanding - a prerequisite to criticism, debate, revision, and improvement."
1096	Timing Data for Information Processes	Every R&D or design organization should have an efficient information service capable of minimizing time spent on searching and gathering pertinent data.. Generalized data on time spent by R&D project staff on information processes is cited.. Suggestions as to the improvement of information activity are offered.
102	Scientific Output and Recognition: A Study in the Operation of the Reward System in Science	The relationship between the quantity and quality of scientific output of 120 university physicists was studied.. Although these two variables are highly correlated, some physicists produce many papers of little significance and other produce a few papers of great significance.. The responses of the community of physicists to these distinct patterns of research publication were investigated.. Quality of output is more significant than quantity in eliciting recognition through the receipt of awards, appointment to prestigious academic departments, and being widely known to one's colleagues.. The reward system operates to encourage creative scientists to be highly productive, to divert the energies of less creative physicists into other channels, and to produce a higher correlation between quantity and quality of output in the top departments than in the weaker departments..
1047	Measurement of Meaning	The scientific study of language has been developing with particular rapidity during the past decade or so.  One thinks immediately of the basic work of Zipf and Skinner, of the developments in information theory, in concept formation, in second language learning, in work association research, and generally of the increasing integration of the psychological and linguistic approaches as reflected in the activities of the Social Science Research Council Committee on Linguistics and Psychology.  Almost every new issue of a social science journal brings additional evidence of this heightened activity. A significant aspect of much of this development has been the devising and application of new quantitative measurement techniques. During the past six or seven years, a group of us at the University of Illinois has been concentrating on the development of an objective measure of meaning, and this book is largely a progress report of that research.
23	Pilot Inventory of Library Holdings	This project was undertaken because of the high degree of uncertainty among the library staff regarding the extent of the problem of missing books.  The findings of this study gave the Ohio State University libraries concrete evidence as to how many books are missing and indicated the areas in which book losses are the greatest.  These figures also provide information which can be conveyed to the faculty or administration when they voice complaints about the unavailability of library books.  The areas where losses are high also tend to indicate the areas of most frequent use.
936	Along the Academic Way	The invitation to apply for this council on Library Resources fellowship stated as one aim to break administrators loose from their desk to read, investigate, and reach for broadening experiences that might make them administrate better. The application listed seven targets of study in the working context of university research libraries: 1) Organizational structures; 2) Management Techniques; 3) Program budgeting; 4) Use of machines, including the computer; 5) Research collection development; 6) Non-book materials in the library; 7) Out-of- building services.
638	Densities of Use, and Absence of Obsolescence, in Physics Journals at M I T	Chen's data for the raw frequency of use of 138 physics journals in the science library at M I T are re-examined and converted to densities of use-per-meter of shelf.. Other units of size for obtaining densities, and their measurement are discussed.. There is no evidence for synchronous obsolescence in the 1955 to 1968 volumes of these journals: instead there is some statistically significant evidence of greater density of use with greater age.. Similar evidence elsewhere is cited.. The ranking order for heaviness of use is also radically altered by converting raw frequencies to densities of use.. It is suggested that, for comparing the relative values of different journals, or age groups, in library use or citation studies, analyses of raw frequencies are valueless, and indeed potentially dangerously misleading, until they are converted to allow for the numbers of available items in each group examined..
237	Book Selection of Censorship	"The key question was whether restrictions are being imposed on librarians, or whether they are imposing restrictions on themselves, that threaten the citizen's right to easy access to as adequate a collection of books and periodicals as his community, his country or his state can afford.  Readers of this report may come to different conclusions about the ""right"" answer to this question, but whether they conclude that librarians are or are not being as forceful as they might be in developing and upholding freedom-to-read principles, it should not be forgotten that it is librarians themselves who have had the courage to provide the evidence."
770	Tests on Abstracts Journals	The amount of scientific and technical information published annually in the form of journal articles, conference papers, reports, theses, patents, and books now greatly exceeds, in every field of interest, the amount which may be scanned by a scientist wishing to keep himself completely up to date in his own subject.  For a scientist wishing to inform himself of new developments in neighbouring subject-fields the problem is even greater.  Consequently, either the scientist reconciles himself to the knowledge that he is not aware of all relevant information in his field or he places increasingly more reliance on such bibliographic tools as are available to guide him towards the relevant literature. First among such tools is the abstracts journal.
743	A Survey of the Use of On-Line Computer-Based Scientific Search Services by Academic Libraries	To explore their use of on-line computer-based bibliographic search services, a one-page questionnaire was sent to 100 academic libraries in the United States having separate departmental chemistry or science libraries.. An attempt was made to determine the background training of the persons performing the searches, who the end users were, the growth trend, the funding, the data bases used, and the value to the users.. Of the 73 replies, 49.3% indicated use of such services, while 24.6% were planning to use them primarily by faculty and graduate students.. Of those reporting, 83.3% used searchers with a background in library or information science; 47.2% had a background in scientific discipline..Two or more on-line services were used by 72.2%.. A majority of respondents stated that the use paid all expenses or a portion of the expenses.. The searches met the needs of the use most of the time in 83.3% of the cases, and all of the time in 5.4%..
172	As We May Think	"As Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Dr. Vannevar Bush has coordinated the activities of some six thousand leading American scientists in the application of science to warfare.  In this significant article he holds up an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased.  He urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge. For years inventions have extended man's physical powers rather than the powers of his mind.  Trip hammers that multiply the fists, microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern science.  Now, says Dr.Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages.  The perfection of these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from their war work.  Like Emerson's famous address of 1837 on ""The American Scholar,"" this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge. - The Editor"
1204	Perceptions An Introduction to Computational Geometry	The goal of this study is to reach a deeper understanding of some concepts we believe are crucial to the general theory of computation. We will study in great detail a class of computations that make decisions by weighing evidence.  Certainly, this problem is of great interest in itself, but our real hope is that understanding of its mathematical structure will prepare us eventually to go further into the almost unexplored theory of parallel computers.
599	On the Evaluation of Information Science	The emergence and development of information science within its wider disciplinary framework is interpreted.. Information science is approached as one of a modern generation of communication or behavioral disciplines which emerged almost simultaneously around World War II.. Consequently, an attempt is made to discern the evolution of relationship between information science and other generation disciplines.. The internal development of information science is first sketched.. Second, possible relationship and roles of information science within a potentially emergent suprasystem of knowledge are discussed..
771	Survey of Information Needs of Physicists and Chemists	Scientific research is expensive and the practical application of its results is even more expensive.  Information services are relatively inexpensive and, by constantly improving their scope and efficiency and encouraging the scientist to make the best use of them, we can minimize duplication and inefficiency in research and development.  This is the justification for the present survey and for all the work on user needs which has preceded it.
872	The Shared Cataloging System of the Ohio College Library Center	Development and implementation of an off-line catalog card production system and on-line shared cataloging system are described.. In off-line production, average cost per card for 529,893 catalog cards in finished form and alphabetized for filing was 6.57c.. An account is given of system design and equipment selection for the on-line system.. File organization and programs are described, and the on-line cataloging system is discussed.. The system is easy to use, efficient, reliable, and cost beneficial..
915	Library research at the University of Lancaster	Reference has been made to work done at the University of Lancaster in recent issues of the RECORD:  this article  summarizes past, present and possible future activities in this field.
1386	The Structure of Scientific Revolutions	The essay that follows is the first full published report on a project originally conceived almost fifteen years ago.  At that time I was a graduate student in theoretical physics already within sight of the end of my dissertation.  A fortunate involvement with an experimental college course treating physical science for the non-scientist provided my first exposure to out-of-date scientific theory and practice radically undermined some of my basic conceptions about the nature of science and the reasons for its special success.
672	Esso Research Experiences with Chemical Abstracts on Microfilm	Late in 1964, The Chemical Abstracts Service announced that in 1965 it would lease Chemical Abstracts in microfilm form to subscribers to its current printed abstracts.  With this move, microfilm entered a new stage - use in technical- information work as a publication medium for frequently employed tools rather than for largely archival documents.
896	Job Dimensions and Educational Needs in Librarianship	This study was undertaken to meet more fully the demands for improved and expanded training of library personnel, especially at the middle and upper levels, occasioned by the rapidly changing roles and functions of libraries as they try to adapt to the vast social, economic, and technological changes currently in progress.  The rise to a higher level of required skills and competencies - often new - has brought about an urgent need for improved training beyond the first professional degree at the post-master's level.  The basic purpose of this research is curriculum development at the post-master's level that will equip the middle- and upper-level personnel in libraries for the changes confronting them.  Although it would be possible to restructure the master's program and add the courses that this study shows a need for, that alternative has not been pursued for two reasons: a fairly stable master's curriculum is widely accepted and institutionalized and, more important, the new courses are designed for a different group of students - experienced librarians.
979	Automated Acquisitions Procedures at the University of Michigan Library	In June 1965, the Acquisitions Department of The University of Michigan Library began using a computer-based system for ordering books and other library materials.  This is the beginning of an over-all automated system for the Acquisitions Department and was designed with the assistance of Robert O. Kindt, Systems Analyst from the University's Office of Management Services.  Preliminary work on the automated system was begun in late 1963, and in September, 1964.  Mr. Kindt was assigned to the University Library on a full-time basis.  After the preliminary proposal was drafted, cost and feasibility studies were made.  Current (i.e., 1964) volume and costs were compared with anticipated volume and costs in 1968 and 1975 for both manual and automated systems.
769	Keywords and Clumps	Recent work at the Cambridge Language Research Unit has been concerned with the development of automatic classification procedures for information retrieval.  This has taken the form of research into methods of classification of keywords extracted from documents, with a view to using the classes found for co-ordinate indexing of technical material.  We cannot claim to have solved this problem because the methods we have been able to develop so far cannot be applied on a sufficiently large scale.  We have, however, made enough progress to make us feel that this a fruitful line of research.
604	Comparison of Document Data Bases	This paper presents a detailed analysis of the content and format of seven machine-readable bibliographic data bases: Chemical Abstract Service Condensates, Chemical and Biological Activities, and Polymer Science and Technology, Biosciences Information Service's BA Previews including Biological Abstracts and BioReseach Index, Institute for Science Information Source Tape, and Engineering Index COMPENDEX.. Selected issue test tapes of each data base were printed and checked for the types of data that were contained in the issue and the methods in which the data were formatted.. This paper compared the physical formats of the tapes and describes the varied treatments given to such data elements as authors, titles, abstracts, etc.. Comparison of data bases requires common use of terms.. All terms are defined at the beginning of the paper.. The authors found great discrepancies in the presentation of essentially similar bibliographic data, and they offer some suggestions for mitigating the discrepancies by use of standards..
368	Economies and Computers	It is not a simple matter to describe this book.  Briefly, it attempts to provide and apply a set of concepts from economic theory that may prove valuable to those who are now or may become decision- makers in the selection, financing, and/or use of computers.  Only theory relevant for such decision-makers is presented here.  This means that the effects of computers on the economy as a whole lie outside the scope of this book, as do a number of related issues.  We deal, thus, with microeconomic, not macroeconomic, theory: our focus is on the small (industry, firm, computer) and not the large (gross national product, consumer price index, unemployment).
561	A Dynamic Programming Approach to R and D Budgeting and Project Selection	Contemporary models of research and development are incomplete in that they ignore the many reappraisals and budgeting decisions that occur in the time between a project's proposal and its commercialization.. The sequential decision aspects of project budgeting are particularly important since 1) the research expenditure is usually an order of magnitude less than the irrevocable investment for commercialization and 2) an allocation to a project today does not presuppose continuation of the project into future periods.. The research and development budgeting problem is structured to take into account the sequential decision characteristic.. Utilizing the technique of dynamic programming, methods are developed to determine optimal project budgets when the aggregate research and development budget is either constrained or unconstrained.. These models also suggest a rational explanation of the patterns of project expenditures over time that one observes in practice.. Finally, some of the shortcomings of the developed methods which inhibit their practical application are discussed..
1099	On Factors Influencing the Attitude of Scientists and Engineers towards Scientific Information	The most important objective factors are considered influencing the limits and the depth of information needs of researchers and designers, i.e. the growth of information flow, the level of specialization, the qualification standard, the official position, the development rates of scientific or technical discipline in question the teamwork on scientific or engineering projects, the language barrier, the specifics of narrowly specialized terminology, as well as a number of subjective (psychological) factors like inclination to creative work, type of memory, the time available, methods of sources handling.. The investigations into, and account of, these factors are indispensable for raising the efficiency both of information systems performance and the activities of scientific and engineering communities served.. Some statistical data are cited obtained during investigations into information demand patterns for various personnel groups at research and development institutions..
300	Faculty Awareness and Attitudes Toward Academic Library Reference Services: A Measure of Communication	A survey of the faculties at six colleges was undertaken to measure the degree to which the libraries of those institutions were communicating with the faculty concerning the availability of various references services.. The results demonstrated that the average faculty member was aware of barely half the services actually available.. Variables of academic rank, length of teaching, and amount of library and reference use were some of the factors shown to affect faculty awareness of library service..
49	Adaptive Information Dissemination	Computer dissemination of information offers significant advantages over manual dissemination because the computer can use strategies that are impractical and in some cases impossible for a human.. This paper describes the Ames Laboratory Selective Dissemination of Information system with emphasis on the effectiveness of user feedback.. The system will accept any document, abstract, keyword, etc., in a KWIC or Science Citation Index Source format.. User profiles consist of words or word clusters each with an initially assigned significance value.. These values are used in making the decision to notify a user that he may be interested in a particular document.. According to responses, the significance values are increased or decreased and quickly attain an equilibrium which accurately describes the user's interests.. The system is economical compared to other existing SDI systems and human intervention is negligible except for adding and deleting profile entries..
1249	Reader in Medical Librarianship	Each kind of librarianship partakes of the general elements of librarianship, and each has a flavor all its own.  This book is intended to present the flavor and philosophy of medical librarianship to the student or novice.  If it gives a new perspective to some practicing librarians or administrators in health science organizations, so much the better. If it were ever possible to think of medical libraries in isolation, it is so no longer.  One must conceive of them as part of a medical system, and indeed as part of a system that goes beyond the narrow confines of medicine as practiced by a single physician for a single patient.  It extends into the health sciences as represented by dentists, pharmacists, nurses, veterinarians, medical technologists, medical associates and dozens of others, some not yet possessing a clear identity.  It includes research, education and practice.  In addition to the clinical sciences, the system involves the preclinical ones and preventive medicine and public health. Increasingly, socioeconomic considerations have moved into the mainstream of medicine.
260	Classification Practice in Britain.  Report on a survey of classification opinion and practice in Great Britain, with particular reference to the Dewey Decimal Classification	The objectives of the Sub-Committee in starting their enquiries were basically three-fold 1) To gather a reasonable collection of statistics relating to the general practice of classification in this country. 2) To gather information on th actual use of the Dewey Decimal Classification in this country. 3) To provide a basis for the recommendations which are provided periodically for the Dewey Editorial Policy Committee from the Library Association Library Research Committee's Sub-Committee on Dewey Decimal Classification Revision. To this end a questionnaire was sent out to over 1100 libraries of all types throughout the country and after six months reminders sent to librarians to ensure they had received them and that none had been overlooked.  The result of this was very pleasing; 716 were returned, the vast majority completed correctly.  The actual figures of type and size of library are given in the body of the report but no type of library is completely omitted and a significant proportion of the larger libraries returned the questionnaire.
148	Fair (Fast Access Information Retrieval) Project; Aims and Methods	I am going to describe in general terms a research project which has been established to explore some of the problems of the use of the literature, particularly in the field of Biomedical Engineering of the National Institute for Medical Research (Hampstead Laboratories).  The project is scheduled to last for three years, and like most research, consists of a number of overlapping stages.  We have reached the stage now of having acquired sufficient equipment and data to start trying out some of our ideas.
135	Design of Information Systems and Services	This review has selected for emphasis reports on concepts of systems analysis and on the procedures for applying these concepts to the design of information systems.  Literature dealing with the automation of libraries and information centers has been explicitly excluded, while material on user studies, file organization, evaluation, etc., is only mentioned briefly since it is covered more thoroughly in other chapters. The selected, relevant, and available literature that has been published in the last year or so is organized into four groups as follows: 1. Articles that help define the process of systems analysis and the relationship to information science. 2. Articles that describe the concepts of systems analysis as applied to the analysis and design of information systems. 3. Articles primarily concerned with the design of document storage and retrieval systems.
830	Progress in Documentation	This article reviews the state of the art in automatic indexing, that is, automatic techniques for analyzing and characterizing documents, for manipulating their descriptions in searching, and for generating the index language used for these purposes.  It concentrates on the literature from 1968 to 1973.  Section I defines the topic and its context.  Sections II and III consider work in syntax and semantics respectively in detail.  Section IV comments on 'indirect' indexing.  Section V briefly surveys operating mechanized systems.  In Section VI major experiments in automatic indexing are reviewed, and Section VII attempts an overall conclusion on the current state of automatic indexing techniques.
1294	Automatic Text Analysis	In this article the principal experiments in automatic text analysis are briefly reviewed, and an indication is given of developments to be expected in the future.
